Core-Wisdom,The Second Mountain,The Quest for a Moral Life,David Brooks,Philosopher's Notes,"David Brooks is one of the nations‚Äô leading writers and commentators. He is an op-ed columnist for the New York Times and appears regularly on PBS NewsHour and Meet the Press. I loved his book The Road to Character. I loved this one even more. David tells us there are two mountains: The first mountain? That‚Äôs what society tells us we should pursue: all the normal trappings of success. The second mountain? That‚Äôs where the magic (and joy!) exists: where we move beyond ourselves and COMMIT (important word for this book!) to giving ourselves most fully to something bigger than ourselves. David identifies four potential commitments: to our families, to our vocations, to our faith/philosophy of life and to our communities. Ultimately, the book is intended to be a guide to the ULTIMATE quest in life: ‚ÄúThe Quest for a Moral Life.‚Äù"

Core-Wisdom,The 5 Second Rule,"Transform Your Life, Work, and Confidence with Everyday Courage",Mel Robbins,Philosopher's Notes,"Mel Robbins is funny, witty and wise. Her TEDx Talk (called How to stop screwing yourself over) is one of the most popular of all time, with more than 18 million views. This book is also super popular‚Äîwith over 1,000 Amazon reviews. It‚Äôs pretty awesome. Actually, the book is REALLY (!) good. In fact, Mel Robbins‚Äô 5 Second Rule might just be one of THE most elegantly efficient Tools we can use to close the gap between who we‚Äôre CAPABLE of being and who we‚Äôre ACTUALLY being. (Seriously.) Big Ideas we explore include The 5 Second Rule (and how/when to rock it), how to win the game of life (hint: start, stay in, for the long game!), excitement + anxiety (and how they feel the same in the body), managing distractions (today a good day?), and changing your life with one moment of everyday courage."

Big Ideas we explore include the two frameworks (entity vs. incremental) and their two goals (performance vs. learning), attributional retraining (aka learning the best way to respond to failure!), and moving from contingent self-worth to wholehearted self-esteem."
Core-Wisdom,Optimizing for the Modern Hƒìr≈ç 101,,,101 Classes,"I created this class after my friend Matt McCall (who helps run the Pritzker Group Venture Capital fund) asked me to do a talk for 60 of their portfolio CEOs. He was thinking ‚ÄúOptimizing for Supheroes 101.‚Äù I loved that idea and decided it would be the perfect context to share my absolute best stuff and here we are. ü§ì In this extra-long class, we start by connecting ‚ÄúOptimizing‚Äù and ‚ÄúHƒìr≈ç‚Äù to their ancient Greek philosophical roots then we proceed to walk thru how to go about integrating ancient wisdom, modern science and practical tools to harness our soul force to build strength for two such that we can create our best, most heroic lives."

Apparently it is recommended alongside that book on Amazon. With 1,400+ reviews, Alexandra thought I might like it. Not only did I like the book, I loved it. And, I fell in love with Richard Rohr.

And‚Ä¶ Unlike many of his academic, professor-of-philosophy peers, he is a practicing Stoic philosopher. In the words of Donald Robertson (another Stoic author and practitioner; see The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), he is both a librarian AND a warrior of the mind. We featured another one of Professor Irvine‚Äôs great books on Stoicism called A Guide to the Good Life. I enjoyed that one quite a bit but I REALLY (!) enjoyed this one. Like, jumbo loved it.

This book is about the philosophical roots of modern psychotherapy. Specifically, it outlines the connection between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Stoicism.

I also really enjoyed how high-performance coach and mental game strategist Todd Herman describes the science behind the power of ‚Äúsecret identities‚Äù to transform our lives and I loved the parallels between his perspective and our Big 3 Identities > Virtues > Behaviors model.

It was called Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. We have Nir to thank for helping make the technology we use better. And... As he says, ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs also a dark side. As philosopher Paul Virilio wrote, ‚ÄòWhen you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck.‚Äô In the case of user-friendly products and services, what makes some products engaging and easy to use can also make them distracting.‚Äù After finding HIMSELF hooked to many of the products created by designers inspired by *his* work, Eyal got himself UNHOOKED and, ultimately INDISTRACTABLE. In this great book, he gives us a practical look at *why* we‚Äôre so vulnerable to getting hooked in the first place and, most importantly, how to make ourselves Indistractable so we can control our attention and choose our lives."

Ancient-Wisdom,Trying Not to Try,"Ancient China, Modern Science, and the Power of Spontaneity",Edward Slingerland,Philosopher's Notes,"Edward Slingerland is one of the world‚Äôs leading experts on both ancient Chinese thought AND modern cognitive science. This book is a melding of those two realms. It‚Äôs a truly fascinating read.

Ancient-Wisdom,The Jefferson Bible,The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth,Thomas Jefferson,Philosopher's Notes,"The Jefferson Bible. Thomas Jefferson created it for himself and never intended it for broad publication. Jefferson *literally* snipped out the passages and parables (from four different translations of the Bible) that he felt best captured the essence of Jesus‚Äôs moral philosophy and conformed with his sense of reason. Big Ideas we cover: Love your enemies (+ everyone else), seek ye first the kingdom of God, take the beam out your eye, use your talents, and build your life on the rock of wisdom."
Ancient-Wisdom,The Daily Stoic,"366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living","Ryan Holiday, Stephen Hanselman",Philosopher's Notes,"This book combines two of my favorite things: Stoicism + Ryan Holiday‚Äôs wisdom. Stoicism was one of the most influential philosophy of the Roman world and has continued to influence many of history‚Äôs greatest minds. As Ryan says: It‚Äôs time to bring it back as a powerful tool ‚Äúin the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance, and wisdom.‚Äù This is one of the my favorite books ever. Big Ideas we explore: the #1 thing to know about Stoicism, how to create tranquility, a good answer to ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the latest and greatest?!,‚Äù the 2 essential tasks in life and the art of acquiescence (aka amor fati)."
Ancient-Wisdom,The Enchiridion,,Epictetus,Philosopher's Notes,"Epictetus is one of three Stoic philosophers we profile (Marcus Aurelius and Seneca are the other two) and this former slave turned leading philosopher of his era is incredible.

We'll have fun tapping into a lot more of his vast mojo in the Note."

The first Note was on The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in which he connects the philosophical underpinnings of CBT (one of the most empirically-validated, effective modern therapies) to ancient Stoicism. This book is part biography and part philosophy. It‚Äôs all awesome. If you want to know how to think like a Roman emperor, start here. I think you‚Äôll enjoy the book as much as I did."
Ancient-Wisdom,How to Be Free,An Ancient Guide to the Stoic Life (Ancient Wisdom for Modern Readers),"Epictetus, A. A. Long",Philosopher's Notes,"A.A. Long is professor emeritus of classics and affiliated professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also one of the world‚Äôs most respected scholars of Stoicism. As per the inside flap, in this beautiful little (hand)book, he provides ‚Äúsplendid new translations and the original Greek on facing pages, a compelling introduction that sets Epictetus in context and describes the importance of Stoic freedom today, and an invaluable glossary of key words and concepts.

In this book, Professor Pigliucci teaches us how to be a Stoic via an imaginary dialogue with Epictetus, one of the leading Stoic teachers of the ancient world. It‚Äôs a wonderfully written, super-smart look at how we can use ‚Äúancient philosophy to live a modern life.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include an introduction to our guide Epictetus, Rule #1 of Stoicism (some things are in our power, others are not), the cardinal virtues (of Stoicism + Science + Optimize), the power of role models (and the Stoic Paradox), and the ultimate how to be a Stoic practice question: How can I use virtue here and now?"
Ancient-Wisdom,The Practicing Stoic,A Philosophical User's Manual,Ward Farnsworth,Philosopher's Notes,"Ward Farnsworth is the Dean of the University of Texas School of Law. As you can imagine, he brings a logical precision to his discussion of Stoicism that is distinct and powerful. (Seriously. It‚Äôs actually ASTONISHINGLY powerful.) I really enjoyed the book and I highly recommend it for the aspiring Practicing Stoic. Big Ideas we explore include Principle #1 of practical Stoicism (Judgment!), the good life vs. the good mood (virtue for the win!), what others think (‚Üê pro tip: ignore it), preferred indifference (committed but not attached), and using adversity as fuel for our Optimizing (use Hermes' magic wand!)."
Ancient-Wisdom,The Obstacle Is the Way,The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph,Ryan Holiday,Philosopher's Notes,Ryan Holiday is brilliant. So is this book. The ancient Stoics taught us how to not only accept challenges but to thrive on them.

This book is about the philosophical roots of modern psychotherapy. Specifically, it outlines the connection between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Stoicism. Big Ideas we explore include being a warrior of the mind vs. a librarian of the mind, your highest human purpose, getting on good terms with your inner daimon, practicing the reserve clause and modeling your ideal sage."
Ancient-Wisdom,Musonius Rufus,Lectures and Sayings,Musonius Rufus,Philosopher's Notes,"Musonius Rufus was one of the four great Roman Stoics. In fact, he was known as the ‚ÄúRoman Socrates.‚Äù To put him in historical context with the other three great Roman Stoics: He was born in AD 30, about 34 years after Seneca. He taught Epictetus (who was born in AD 55). Epictetus died in 135 but taught the guys who taught the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (who was born in AD 121) his Stoic philosophy‚Äîwhich is why Aurelius refers to him more than any other teacher in Meditations. Big Ideas we explore include: Theory vs. Practice (which is more important?), practicing philosophy (is where it's at!), vice vs. exile (free yourself from vice!), food (it's the medicine of life), and stoic love advice (competing in kindness)."
Ancient-Wisdom,The Stoic Challenge,"A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient",William B. Irvine,Philosopher's Notes,"William B. Irvine is a professor of philosophy at Wright State University. He‚Äôs also a fantastic (and prolific) writer. And‚Ä¶ Unlike many of his academic, professor-of-philosophy peers, he is a practicing Stoic philosopher. In the words of Donald Robertson (another Stoic author and practitioner; see The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), he is both a librarian AND a warrior of the mind. We featured another one of Professor Irvine‚Äôs great books on Stoicism called A Guide to the Good Life. I enjoyed that one quite a bit but I REALLY (!) enjoyed this one. Like, jumbo loved it. In fact, I‚Äôm going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism‚Äîalong with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday‚Äôs The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic.

Ancient-Wisdom,Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot,,James Stockdale,Philosopher's Notes,"Vice Admiral James Stockdale is an American hero. Stockdale spent nearly eight years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He spent four of those years in solitary confinement and was repeatedly tortured.

This is an incredibly inspiring look at the powerful mind and equally powerful moral commitment of a hero. Big Ideas we explore: Being our brother‚Äôs keeper, chiseling our integrity to achieve delight with life, courage as endurance of the soul and heroes vs. bums."
Ancient-Wisdom,Courage Under Fire,Testing Epictetus's Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior,James Stockdale,Philosopher's Notes,"James Stockdale spent 7 1/2 years as the highest ranking prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. 4 years in solitary confinement. 2 in leg irons.

Ego Is the Enemy is now one of my favorite books of 2016. It‚Äôs fantastic. Big Ideas we explore include: defining ego, becoming more than a flash in the pan, finally answering the question of whether it takes 10,000 or 20,000 hours to attain mastery, the virtue and value of staying true to your own path and making it rather than faking it."
Ancient-Wisdom,Stillness Is the Key,,Ryan Holiday,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our fourth Note on one of Ryan Holiday‚Äôs books. Ryan is one of my absolute favorite writers. One of the testimonials in the front of the book perfectly captures my sentiment. Screenwriter and director Brian Koppelman (Rounders, Ocean‚Äôs Thirteen and Billions) puts it this way: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have many rules in life, but one I never break is: If Ryan Holiday writes a book, I read it as soon as I can get my hands on it.‚Äù (btw: Cal Newport‚Äôs the first testimonial. He says: ‚ÄúSome authors give advice. Ryan Holiday distills wisdom. This book is a must read.‚Äù) Penguin Random House sent me an advance copy of this book. As I knew it would be: It‚Äôs fantastic. Of course, the book‚Äôs packed with Big Ideas and I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorites so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"
Ancient-Wisdom,Letters from a Stoic,,Seneca,Philosopher's Notes,"Seneca. He was born around the same time as Jesus and was one of the leading figures in his Roman Empire. He was also one of history's leading Stoic philosophers (along with Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus who we also profile) and has some powerful wisdom to share. In this Note, we'll explore the purpose of philosophy, the importance of focusing our attention and the mojo that comes from facing our fears."
Ancient-Wisdom,A Guide to the Good Life,The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,William B. Irvine,Philosopher's Notes,"Stoicism. I love it.

As we discussed in our Notes on True Success, The Art of Achievement, and Superheroes and Philosophy, Tom Morris got a dual Ph.D. from Yale in Philosophy and Religious Studies. Then he taught at Notre Dame for fifteen years before lecturing widely. This book combines two of my favorite things: Tom Morris‚Äôs practical, philosophical wisdom with Stoic philosophy.

Ancient-Wisdom,Plato‚Äôs Lemonade Stand,Stirring Change into Something Great,Tom Morris,Philosopher's Notes,"Tom Morris has a joint Ph.D. from Yale in Religious Studies and Philosophy and is one of the most popular teachers in Notre Dame‚Äôs history. He‚Äôs one of my favorite teachers. In this book, he distills decades of wisdom into the ultimate philosophical lemonade-making recipe. Big Ideas we explore include lemon alchemy (Antifragility for the win!), the Big 3 + 1 (Socrates + Aristotle + Ockham --> Self-knowledge + Ideals + Courage + Simplicity), Plato‚Äôs Ideals (and yours), ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Getting Nervous!‚Äù (--> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting ready!‚Äù), and The Alchemy of Life (fuel for the second mountain)."

We‚Äôve featured two of his other books in which he brings ancient wisdom to our modern lives: True Success and The Art of Achievement. (He‚Äôs also the philosopher behind Philosophy for Dummies and wrote If Aristotle Ran General Motors and If Harry Potter Ran General Electric.) I got this book after he and I had an electric chat about Optimize 2020 and the role of The Modern Hero. It‚Äôs a collection of essays written by some of the smartest and wisest academic philosophers out there. Tom edited it with his son, Matt‚Äîwhich makes me think of *another* book we‚Äôve featured on the wisdom of superheroes written by a dynamic father-son duo: Deepak Chopra and his son Gotham who wrote The Seven Spiritual Laws of Superheroes. I loved diving into some of the deeper philosophical questions inherent to our modern superhero tales. If that sounds like fun, I‚Äôll think you‚Äôll enjoy it as well. Of course, the book is packed with Big Ideas so, KABAM! Let‚Äôs throw on our spandex tights and capes and jump straight in."

He is a true master and it‚Äôs a joy to connect with his powerful wisdom. I picked this book off the shelf after fires nearly burned down our town. It felt like a good time to remind myself of the fact that the good life is not‚Äîand cannot be‚Äîexclusively ‚Äúgood‚Äù times. Want a beautiful lotus flower? Embrace the mud. No mud, no lotus. Want a wonderful, flourishing life? Embrace the challenges. No challenges, no flourishing.

We'll also explore the place beyond idiot compassion as we become integrated human beings giving ourselves joyfully to the world."
Ancient-Wisdom,Everyday Zen,Love and Work,Charlotte Joko Beck,Philosopher's Notes,"Charlotte Joko Beck was the founder and former head teacher at the Zen Center in San Diego. I bought this book 10 years ago but it wasn‚Äôt until Eleanor recently pulled it off the shelf and dropped it on the ground that I picked it up and read it. (Very Zen, eh? lol) The book is a collection of edited talks Joko gave at her Zen center. It was published in 1989 when she was 82. (She passed away at 94 in 2011.)

The Ideas: Actualizer + Choice + Flow + Virtues + Mindsets + Willpower + Optimalist + WOOP + Why + Stress."
Positive-Psychology,Motivation and Personality,,Abraham Maslow,Philosopher's Notes,"Abraham Maslow tells us, ""What one can be, one must be!"" (OMG I love that.) He was a 20th century humanistic psychologist who came up with the hierarchy of needs and studied the most exceptional people of his era. In this Note, we'll explore some of the Big Ideas on how we can be all that we're destined to be and look at some of the characteristics of those self-actualizing human beings who're rockin' it."

In the Note, we'll explore the fact that our attitudes determine our happiness and that *no one* can ever take away the freedom for us to choose our response to any given situation.

Positive-Psychology,Rethinking Positive Thinking,Inside the New Science of Motivation,Gabriele Oettingen,Philosopher's Notes,"Gabriel Oettingen is one of the world‚Äôs leading researchers in ‚ÄúThe New Science of Motivation.‚Äù The basic idea of the book is captured in a clever image on the cover: Rose colored glasses with one lens cracked. Oettingen walks us thru the compelling research that demonstrates the power of seeing both the positive AND the challenges. When we contrast our wishes with the obstacles to their attainment we, almost magically, catalyze an extraordinarily higher level of performance."
Positive-Psychology,Grit,The Power of Passion and Perseverance,Angela Duckworth,Philosopher's Notes,"Angela Duckworth is the world‚Äôs leading authority on the science of grit.

Positive-Psychology,The Joy of Movement,"How exercise helps us find happiness, hope, connection, and courage",Kelly McGonigal,Philosopher's Notes,"I‚Äôm a big fan of Kelly McGonigal and her ability to help us apply scientific wisdom to our lives. We‚Äôve covered two of her earlier books: The Willpower Instinct and The Upside of Stress. So... When I got this book, knew I‚Äôd enjoy it. But, I didn‚Äôt anticipate JUST how much I‚Äôd love it. We have some great Notes on Movement (Spark, Spartan Up and No Sweat among my favorites), but Kelly‚Äôs book will be our new go-to for the science of WHY exercise/movement is so essential to our well-being. It‚Äôs PHENOMENAL. Reading about the SCIENCE behind stories of transformation (and how, as per the sub-title of her book: ‚ÄúExercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage‚Äù) also made me that much more clear on the power of what we‚Äôre doing with all of our work and the importance of focusing so much on Energy (especially with our Mastery and Coach programs). Big Ideas we explore include: Hope Molecules (and how to create them), persistence highs (and how to create them), collective effervescence (and why it's so awesome), how we endure (hint: TOGETHER!), and OMMS!!! (Obstacles (literally!) Make Me Stronger!)."
Positive-Psychology,What Doesn't Kill Us,The New Psychology of Posttraumatic Growth,Stephen Joseph Ph.D.,Philosopher's Notes,"Stephen Joseph is one of the world‚Äôs leading researchers on the science of posttraumatic growth. He is also a professor and therapist. He started his career studying posttraumatic stress. In the process, he saw that many people experienced significant growth as a result of the stress they endured--at which point, he started developing his ideas on posttraumatic growth. Fast-forward a few decades and here we are. the title is a play on Nietzsche‚Äôs famous dictum: ‚ÄúWhat doesn‚Äôt kill me makes me stronger.‚Äù While the sub-title perfectly captures the focus of the book: ‚ÄúThe New Psychology of Posttraumatic Growth.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include: Eudaimonic Treadmills (note: there aren't any!), posttraumatic growth (and how to use stress as the engine for growth), the shattered vase (taking the pieces and making an antifragile mosaic), harvesting hope (the 1 + 2 + 3s for trauma survivors)."

In this Note, we take a quick look at The Gift that we all have that‚Äôs the key to our potential greatness, HOW to go about tapping into the benefits of that gift via a certain type of practice (forget naive practice and go for purposeful + deliberate!), the fact that there is no such thing as a ‚Äú10,000 Hour Rule,‚Äù and why we should be called Homo Exercens rather than Homo Sapiens. :)"

Positive-Psychology,Gratitude Works!,A 21-Day Program for Creating Emotional Prosperity,Robert A. Emmons,Philosopher's Notes,"I‚Äôm grateful for Robert Emmons. He‚Äôs dedicated the last three decades of his life to understanding the science of how to boost our well-being. In the process, he‚Äôs conducted ground-breaking research on the power of gratitude. In fact, he‚Äôs basically THE researcher we have to thank for understanding *just* how powerful gratitude journaling is. (He's also served as editor-in-chief of The Journal of Positive Psychology.) I consider myself a reasonably grateful guy but this book has opened my eyes to JUST how powerful gratitude is. And, to just how important it is to DELIBERATELY PRACTICE it. Big Ideas we explore include: How to give yourself a 25% (!!!) boost in happiness, the top gratitude practices, the #1 obstacle to gratitude (and its remedy), and using challenges for grateful fuel!"

We have featured two of the books he published during his lifetime: Toward a Psychology of Being and Motivation and Personality. Although this book has only ONE review on Amazon and I could only buy a used copy of it, I knew I‚Äôd love it. And, although I had already been deeply influenced by Maslow and his thinking, there was something about reading his unpublished essays and journal thoughts that made me feel that much more connected to this great man. Big Ideas we explore include Maslow‚Äôs thoughts on the ‚Äúeupsychian ideal‚Äù (aka: the ‚Äúeudaemonic ideal‚Äù!), the psychology of happiness (eudaimonology!!), Stoic philosophy (Maslow was a fan), vicious cultural influences (Maslow was NOT a fan!), and the Jonah Complex (ANSWER YOUR HEROIC CALL, already!!)."

The most comprehensive and readable look at what we *scientifically know* works to boost our happiness‚Äîfrom gratitude and exercise to optimism and kindness. (btw: The other #1 book I'd recommend? The PhilosophersNotes workbook. How can you beat 1,000 Big Ideas from 100 great books packed into 600 pages? ;)"
Positive-Psychology,The Upside of Stress,"Why Stress Is Good for You, and How to Get Good at It",Kelly McGonigal,Philosopher's Notes,"If you‚Äôve ever had stress in your life (hah!) and wondered how to deal with it more optimally, I think you‚Äôll love this. McGonigal tells us that how we THINK about stress plays a huge role in its affect on us and walks us thru the science behind it. Rather than try to get rid of stress (good luck with that!), we‚Äôre much better off shifting our mindsets to embrace and use the stress wisely!"

And Maybe the World‚Äù that was inspired by McRaven‚Äôs commencement address at the University of Texas at Austin that went viral.

Mental-Toughness,Sea Stories,My Life in Special Operations,Admiral William H. McRaven,Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book immediately after finishing Admiral McRaven‚Äôs first book, Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life... And Maybe the World. That one‚Äôs a quick-reading little book on the ten lessons McRaven learned in his SEAL training that we can all apply to our modern lives. It was fantastic.

I didn‚Äôt expect it to be THIS good. The words literally explode off the page. Not just because each micro-chapter was an incredibly inspiring micro-manifesto but because each word was written by a man so clearly living in complete integrity with his deepest values. John Maxwell would say his ‚Äúmoral authority‚Äù is extraordinary. I‚Äôd say his SOUL FORCE is palpable. If you‚Äôre in the mood for a soul-rattling call-to-disciplined action, I think you‚Äôll enjoy the book as much as I did."
Mental-Toughness,Fearless,The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown,Eric Blehm,Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book after my friend, retired Navy SEAL Captain Bob Schoultz, recommended it to me.

Stoicism,Courage Is Calling,Fortune Favors the Brave (The Stoic Virtues Series),Ryan Holiday,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our fifth note on one of Ryan Holiday‚Äôs books. As I told my wife Alexandra after reading the first part of this book ‚ÄúRyan is truly an INCREDIBLE writer.‚Äù As in, an ASTONISHINGLY compelling writer. He has truly mastered his craft‚Äîwhich is why he‚Äôs one of the world‚Äôs bestselling living philosophers whose books have sold more than four million copies. The book has three parts: Part I on Fear; Part II on Courage; and Part III on The Heroic. It‚Äôs packed with Big Ideas. Let‚Äôs explore a few my favorites now as we strive to show up with more Wisdom, Self-Mastery, COURAGE, and Love‚Äînot someday but TODAY."
Stoicism,The Enchiridion,,Epictetus,Philosopher's Notes,"Epictetus is one of three Stoic philosophers we profile (Marcus Aurelius and Seneca are the other two) and this former slave turned leading philosopher of his era is incredible. He echoes the wisdom of all the great teachers as he reminds us that, if we want to be happy, we've gotta realize the only thing we have control over is our response to a situation. We'll have fun tapping into a lot more of his vast mojo in the Note."
Stoicism,Discourses,,Epictetus,Philosopher's Notes,"Epictetus is known as one of the world‚Äôs leading Stoic philosophers. (Along with Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, the three make up a very interesting bunch.) Epictetus was a former slave turned philosopher who lived from 55-135 (a little later than Seneca and before Aurelius). This book is a transcription of the informal lectures Epictetus gave to his students. It‚Äôs awesome. Big Ideas we explore: why Hercules needed challenges (and so do you), what figs can teach us about greatness, the good + the bad + the indifferent and how to tell the difference, ‚Äúimpressions‚Äù and the tricks they play, and the fact NOW is the time to live this stuff."
Stoicism,Letters from a Stoic,,Seneca,Philosopher's Notes,"Seneca. He was born around the same time as Jesus and was one of the leading figures in his Roman Empire. He was also one of history's leading Stoic philosophers (along with Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus who we also profile) and has some powerful wisdom to share. In this Note, we'll explore the purpose of philosophy, the importance of focusing our attention and the mojo that comes from facing our fears."
Stoicism,On the Shortness of Life,Life Is Long If You Know How to Use It,Seneca,Philosopher's Notes,"Seneca was an old-school Roman statesman and one of history‚Äôs leading Stoic philosophers. In this book he tells us that life is only short if you don‚Äôt know how to use it and also gives us some tips on how to deal with challenging times and cultivate tranquility. Big Ideas we explore include making T.O.D.A.Y. the day, how to deal with being exiled (never know when it could happen ;), and why flexibility is the virtuous road to tranquility (and how to avoid the detours)."
Stoicism,Musonius Rufus,Lectures and Sayings,Musonius Rufus,Philosopher's Notes,"Musonius Rufus was one of the four great Roman Stoics. In fact, he was known as the ‚ÄúRoman Socrates.‚Äù To put him in historical context with the other three great Roman Stoics: He was born in AD 30, about 34 years after Seneca. He taught Epictetus (who was born in AD 55). Epictetus died in 135 but taught the guys who taught the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (who was born in AD 121) his Stoic philosophy‚Äîwhich is why Aurelius refers to him more than any other teacher in Meditations. Big Ideas we explore include: Theory vs. Practice (which is more important?), practicing philosophy (is where it's at!), vice vs. exile (free yourself from vice!), food (it's the medicine of life), and stoic love advice (competing in kindness)."
Stoicism,How to Think Like a Roman Emperor,The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius,Donald Robertson,Philosopher's Notes,"Donald Robertson is one of the world‚Äôs leading thinkers, writers AND practitioners of Stoic philosophy. He‚Äôs also a therapist who integrates Stoicism into his work with individuals. This is our second Note on one of his great books. The first Note was on The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in which he connects the philosophical underpinnings of CBT (one of the most empirically-validated, effective modern therapies) to ancient Stoicism. This book is part biography and part philosophy. It‚Äôs all awesome. If you want to know how to think like a Roman emperor, start here. I think you‚Äôll enjoy the book as much as I did."
Stoicism,The Obstacle Is the Way,The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph,Ryan Holiday,Philosopher's Notes,Ryan Holiday is brilliant. So is this book. The ancient Stoics taught us how to not only accept challenges but to thrive on them. Ryan brings their wisdom to life with compelling stories of great peeps who have rocked it in the face of adversity. In the Note we'll take a quick look at the three keys to making obstacles work for us: Perception + Action + Will.
Stoicism,The Inner Citadel,The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,Pierre Hadot,Philosopher's Notes,"Pierre Hadot was one of the most influential historians of ancient philosophy. In this book, he gives us an incredible look at Marcus Aurelius and his classic Meditations. You can feel Hadot‚Äôs incredible intellectual rigor and equally incredible passion for engaged philosophy. It‚Äôs inspiring. Big Ideas we explore include spiritual exercises, your inner citadel, your daim≈çn, amor fate, turning obstacles upside down and carpe aret√©."
Stoicism,How to Be Free,An Ancient Guide to the Stoic Life (Ancient Wisdom for Modern Readers),"Epictetus, A. A. Long",Philosopher's Notes,"A.A. Long is professor emeritus of classics and affiliated professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also one of the world‚Äôs most respected scholars of Stoicism. As per the inside flap, in this beautiful little (hand)book, he provides ‚Äúsplendid new translations and the original Greek on facing pages, a compelling introduction that sets Epictetus in context and describes the importance of Stoic freedom today, and an invaluable glossary of key words and concepts. The result is an unmatched introduction to this powerful method of managing emotions and handling life‚Äôs situations, from the most ordinary to the most demanding.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include freedom vs. slavery, the ultimate target (progress!), wisdom daggers (ready at hand), Rule #1 of Stoicism, how to win at life and using our full powers."
Stoicism,How to Be a Stoic,Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life,Massimo Pigliucci,Philosopher's Notes,"Massimo Pigliucci is a Professor of Philosophy at City College of New York. He has three PhDs‚Äîone in genetics, another in evolutionary biology and a third in philosophy. And, most importantly for our purposes, he‚Äôs a practicing Stoic philosopher. In this book, Professor Pigliucci teaches us how to be a Stoic via an imaginary dialogue with Epictetus, one of the leading Stoic teachers of the ancient world. It‚Äôs a wonderfully written, super-smart look at how we can use ‚Äúancient philosophy to live a modern life.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include an introduction to our guide Epictetus, Rule #1 of Stoicism (some things are in our power, others are not), the cardinal virtues (of Stoicism + Science + Optimize), the power of role models (and the Stoic Paradox), and the ultimate how to be a Stoic practice question: How can I use virtue here and now?"
Stoicism,The Practicing Stoic,A Philosophical User's Manual,Ward Farnsworth,Philosopher's Notes,"Ward Farnsworth is the Dean of the University of Texas School of Law. As you can imagine, he brings a logical precision to his discussion of Stoicism that is distinct and powerful. (Seriously. It‚Äôs actually ASTONISHINGLY powerful.) I really enjoyed the book and I highly recommend it for the aspiring Practicing Stoic. Big Ideas we explore include Principle #1 of practical Stoicism (Judgment!), the good life vs. the good mood (virtue for the win!), what others think (‚Üê pro tip: ignore it), preferred indifference (committed but not attached), and using adversity as fuel for our Optimizing (use Hermes' magic wand!)."
Stoicism,The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy,Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy,Donald Robertson,Philosopher's Notes,"Got problems with your soul? These days, you‚Äôd see a psychotherapist. But, back in the day, it was the philosopher who‚Äôd help you optimize‚Äîthey were the preferred physician of the soul. This book is about the philosophical roots of modern psychotherapy. Specifically, it outlines the connection between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Stoicism. Big Ideas we explore include being a warrior of the mind vs. a librarian of the mind, your highest human purpose, getting on good terms with your inner daimon, practicing the reserve clause and modeling your ideal sage."
Stoicism,The Stoic Challenge,"A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient",William B. Irvine,Philosopher's Notes,"William B. Irvine is a professor of philosophy at Wright State University. He‚Äôs also a fantastic (and prolific) writer. And‚Ä¶ Unlike many of his academic, professor-of-philosophy peers, he is a practicing Stoic philosopher. In the words of Donald Robertson (another Stoic author and practitioner; see The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), he is both a librarian AND a warrior of the mind. We featured another one of Professor Irvine‚Äôs great books on Stoicism called A Guide to the Good Life. I enjoyed that one quite a bit but I REALLY (!) enjoyed this one. Like, jumbo loved it. In fact, I‚Äôm going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism‚Äîalong with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday‚Äôs The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic. If you‚Äôre looking for ‚ÄúA Philosopher‚Äôs Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient,‚Äù I think you‚Äôll enjoy it as much as I did. I HIGHLY recommend it."
Stoicism,Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot,,James Stockdale,Philosopher's Notes,"Vice Admiral James Stockdale is an American hero. Stockdale spent nearly eight years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He spent four of those years in solitary confinement and was repeatedly tortured. He was the commanding officer of hundreds of other U.S. soldiers and received the Medal of Honor for his service beyond the call of duty. This is an incredibly inspiring look at the powerful mind and equally powerful moral commitment of a hero. Big Ideas we explore: Being our brother‚Äôs keeper, chiseling our integrity to achieve delight with life, courage as endurance of the soul and heroes vs. bums."
Stoicism,Courage Under Fire,Testing Epictetus's Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior,James Stockdale,Philosopher's Notes,"James Stockdale spent 7 1/2 years as the highest ranking prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. 4 years in solitary confinement. 2 in leg irons. This book is about how he endured all of that with the wisdom of Stoic philosopher Epictetus in mind. In the Note, we explore the key tenets of Stoicism, the Stockdale Paradox, playing your role well and mastering your emotions."
Stoicism,Ego Is the Enemy,,Ryan Holiday,Philosopher's Notes,"Meet the enemy: Your ego. Our guide, Ryan Holiday, wrote one of my favorite books of 2015: The Obstacle Is the Way. Ego Is the Enemy is now one of my favorite books of 2016. It‚Äôs fantastic. Big Ideas we explore include: defining ego, becoming more than a flash in the pan, finally answering the question of whether it takes 10,000 or 20,000 hours to attain mastery, the virtue and value of staying true to your own path and making it rather than faking it."
Stoicism,Stillness Is the Key,,Ryan Holiday,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our fourth Note on one of Ryan Holiday‚Äôs books. Ryan is one of my absolute favorite writers. One of the testimonials in the front of the book perfectly captures my sentiment. Screenwriter and director Brian Koppelman (Rounders, Ocean‚Äôs Thirteen and Billions) puts it this way: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have many rules in life, but one I never break is: If Ryan Holiday writes a book, I read it as soon as I can get my hands on it.‚Äù (btw: Cal Newport‚Äôs the first testimonial. He says: ‚ÄúSome authors give advice. Ryan Holiday distills wisdom. This book is a must read.‚Äù) Penguin Random House sent me an advance copy of this book. As I knew it would be: It‚Äôs fantastic. Of course, the book‚Äôs packed with Big Ideas and I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorites so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"
Stoicism,A Guide to the Good Life,The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,William B. Irvine,Philosopher's Notes,"Stoicism. I love it. Although pretty obscure today, Stoicism was once the primary philosophy of the Western world. (We‚Äôve done Notes on the three leading Stoics: Marcus Aurelius and his Meditations, Seneca and his Letters from a Stoic, and Epictetus and his Enchiridion.) In this, Note, we‚Äôll cover some of the essential ideas of the Stoic philosophical approach along with some Big Ideas on the art of living, the true meaning of virtue, how to visualize and the fact that we‚Äôre living in a dream world."
Stoicism,The Stoic Art of Living,Inner Resilience and Outer Results,Tom Morris,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our fourth Note on one of Tom Morris‚Äôs books. As we discussed in our Notes on True Success, The Art of Achievement, and Superheroes and Philosophy, Tom Morris got a dual Ph.D. from Yale in Philosophy and Religious Studies. Then he taught at Notre Dame for fifteen years before lecturing widely. This book combines two of my favorite things: Tom Morris‚Äôs practical, philosophical wisdom with Stoic philosophy. Big Ideas we explore include: Inner Confidence (and how to build it; remember: ""Disaster is virtue's opportunity.""), philosophy and what it's really about, how to deal with stress (pro tip: put it in a cosmic perspective), authentic living (and how to train it), and an emperor's wisdom for the battles of life."
Stoicism,Man's Search For Meaning,An Introduction to Logotherapy,Viktor Frankl,Philosopher's Notes,"Viktor Frankl survived the horrors of the holocaust and describes his Logotherapy in this classic book. In the Note, we'll explore the fact that our attitudes determine our happiness and that *no one* can ever take away the freedom for us to choose our response to any given situation. We'll also look at the importance of having a mission in life and that as we serve something bigger than ourselves, our happiness and success will follow."
Stoicism,Plato‚Äôs Lemonade Stand,Stirring Change into Something Great,Tom Morris,Philosopher's Notes,"Tom Morris has a joint Ph.D. from Yale in Religious Studies and Philosophy and is one of the most popular teachers in Notre Dame‚Äôs history. He‚Äôs one of my favorite teachers. In this book, he distills decades of wisdom into the ultimate philosophical lemonade-making recipe. Big Ideas we explore include lemon alchemy (Antifragility for the win!), the Big 3 + 1 (Socrates + Aristotle + Ockham --> Self-knowledge + Ideals + Courage + Simplicity), Plato‚Äôs Ideals (and yours), ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Getting Nervous!‚Äù (--> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting ready!‚Äù), and The Alchemy of Life (fuel for the second mountain)."
Stoicism,Superheroes and Philosophy,"Truth, Justice, and the Socratic Way (Popular Culture and Philosophy)","Tom Morris, Matt Morris",Philosopher's Notes,"Tom Morris is one of my favorite modern philosophers. He has a dual Ph.D. from Yale in both Philosophy and Religious Studies. He also taught at Notre Dame for 15 years before becoming one of the most sought-after practical philosophers. We‚Äôve featured two of his other books in which he brings ancient wisdom to our modern lives: True Success and The Art of Achievement. (He‚Äôs also the philosopher behind Philosophy for Dummies and wrote If Aristotle Ran General Motors and If Harry Potter Ran General Electric.) I got this book after he and I had an electric chat about Optimize 2020 and the role of The Modern Hero. It‚Äôs a collection of essays written by some of the smartest and wisest academic philosophers out there. Tom edited it with his son, Matt‚Äîwhich makes me think of *another* book we‚Äôve featured on the wisdom of superheroes written by a dynamic father-son duo: Deepak Chopra and his son Gotham who wrote The Seven Spiritual Laws of Superheroes. I loved diving into some of the deeper philosophical questions inherent to our modern superhero tales. If that sounds like fun, I‚Äôll think you‚Äôll enjoy it as well. Of course, the book is packed with Big Ideas so, KABAM! Let‚Äôs throw on our spandex tights and capes and jump straight in."

That‚Äôs where the magic (and joy!) exists: where we move beyond ourselves and COMMIT (important word for this book!) to giving ourselves most fully to something bigger than ourselves.

Purpose,Falling Upward,A Spirituality for the Two Halves of Life,"Richard Rohr, OFM",Philosopher's Notes,"Alexandra got this book for me after I told her how much I loved David Brooks‚Äô The Second Mountain. Apparently it is recommended alongside that book on Amazon. With 1,400+ reviews, Alexandra thought I might like it. Not only did I like the book, I loved it. And, I fell in love with Richard Rohr. Father Rohr is a Franciscan priest who beautifully integrates his faith with wisdom from various perspectives.

We named our son Emerson after this great 19th century philosopher and when I imagine the heroes whose qualities I want to emulate, he‚Äôs on the top of the list. Big Ideas we explore include: Trust thyself (every heart vibrates to that iron string!), nonconformity (and the integrity of your own mind), what must you do? (vs. what will they think?), Hobgoblins (begone), your voyage (of a thousand zigs and zags), and the Royal You (act like that now!)."

We have featured two of the books he published during his lifetime: Toward a Psychology of Being and Motivation and Personality. Although this book has only ONE review on Amazon and I could only buy a used copy of it, I knew I‚Äôd love it. And, although I had already been deeply influenced by Maslow and his thinking, there was something about reading his unpublished essays and journal thoughts that made me feel that much more connected to this great man. Big Ideas we explore include Maslow‚Äôs thoughts on the ‚Äúeupsychian ideal‚Äù (aka: the ‚Äúeudaemonic ideal‚Äù!), the psychology of happiness (eudaimonology!!), Stoic philosophy (Maslow was a fan), vicious cultural influences (Maslow was NOT a fan!), and the Jonah Complex (ANSWER YOUR HEROIC CALL, already!!)."

We are losing solitude without even realizing it.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include the big 4 of solitude (clarity + creativity + emotional balance + moral courage), the threats from our ""Input Age,"" how MLK and Eisenhower used solitude, FOMO (get over it!) and how to change the world (starting with YOU!)."
Leadership,The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership,Follow Them and People Will Follow You (10th Anniversary Edition),John C. Maxwell,Philosopher's Notes,"John Maxwell is one of the world‚Äôs leading authorities on leadership. He‚Äôs trained millions (literally) of leaders and has written over 50 (!) books that have sold over 13 million copies‚Äîthis one alone has sold over 3 million copies. After a super quick look at the 21 Laws, Big Ideas we explore: The Law of Process (aka: Leaders are learners), the foundation of leadership (= trust), leaders are practical AND visionary, the law of victory (!), and your legacy‚Äîwhat will people say when you die? + What‚Äôs your ‚Äúlife sentence‚Äù?"
Leadership,The Wisdom of the Bullfrog,Leadership Made Simple (But Not Easy),Admiral William H. McRaven,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our fourth Note on one of Admiral McRaven‚Äôs great books. As we discussed in the previous Notes, as a four-star admiral, McRaven‚Äôs final assignment was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces. He served as a Navy SEAL for 37 years. By the time he hit 34 years of service, he was officially anointed as the ‚ÄúBull Frog‚Äù‚Äîthe longest serving frogman and Navy SEAL on active duty. This book, as per the title, is wisdom from this legendary bullfrog. McRaven distills leadership into its most fundamental components, delivering on the subtitle: ‚ÄúLeadership Made Simple (But Not Easy).‚Äù As you‚Äôd expect, it‚Äôs PACKED with practical wisdom."
Leadership,Call Sign Chaos,Learning to Lead,"Jim Mattis, Bing West",Philosopher's Notes,"General Jim Mattis is the former Secretary of Defense and one of the most formidable strategic thinkers of the twenty-first century. He wrote this book with Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine. This book is, as per the back cover, ‚Äúa clear-eyed account of learning to lead in a chaotic world‚Äù in which Mattis ‚Äúrecounts the foundational experiences and lessons he learned over four decades and in three wars. It is a journey about learning to lead at every level, with insights equally applicable to the military, to business, and to individual growth.‚Äù I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a long-time student (and Heroic Coach) who also happens to be a commanding officer in the U.S. military. It‚Äôs an absolutely FANTASTIC memoir packed with wisdom on how to lead‚Äîwhich is why it has nearly 5,000 5-star reviews. The book reminds me of two other memoirs by military leaders I admire: Admiral William McRaven‚Äôs Sea Stories and General Colin Powell‚Äôs It Worked for Me. It also reminds me of Phil Knight‚Äôs memoir Shoe Dog and Ray Dalio‚Äôs Principles. And... For related books on leadership, check out our Notes on General Stanley McChrystal‚Äôs Leaders: Myths and Reality plus Doris Kearns Goodwin‚Äôs Leadership in Turbulent Times. As you‚Äôd expect, this book is packed with Big Ideas. I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorites so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"
Leadership,On Becoming a Leader,,Warren Bennis,Philosopher's Notes,"Warren Bennis is one of the world‚Äôs leading authorities on leadership. This is, as Peter Drucker puts it, his ‚Äúmost important book.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include the basic ingredients of leadership (#1 = Guiding Vision!), the importance of self-invention (hint: write your own story!), the power of trusting ourselves, choosing to express ourselves rather than prove ourselves, how to cultivate trust, and becoming a world-class leader."
Leadership,Leaders,Myth and Reality,"General (Ret.) Stanley McChrystal, Jeff Eggers, Jason Mangone",Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book after I saw General Stanley McChrystal‚Äôs blurb on the back of Ryan Holiday‚Äôs Lives of the Stoics. I read it in one 8.8-hour Deep Work-filled day. It‚Äôs fantastic. McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history‚Äôs most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there‚Äôs a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the ‚Äúmyths‚Äù of leadership and the MUCH MESSIER ‚Äúrealities‚Äù of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership. We end the book with the sober recognition of just how complex, dynamic and context-specific good leadership is. It‚Äôs a challenging, important book that‚Äôs difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership. So... Let‚Äôs get to work!"
Leadership,Make Your Bed,Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World,Admiral William H. McRaven,Philosopher's Notes,"Admiral William H. McRaven is a Retired U.S. Navy SEAL who served for thirty-seven years and commanded at every level. As a Four-Star Admiral, his final assignment was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces. (During this time, he oversaw the covert mission that killed Osama bin Laden.) In 2014, he gave the commencement address to the graduates of the University of Texas at Austin. Millions of people wound up watching his speech on ten lessons he learned from his Navy SEAL training. This book takes a deeper look at those ten lessons. It‚Äôs a super-quick read‚Äîpacked with simple, yet profound wisdom along with moving stories of moral exemplars. It's FANTASTIC."
Leadership,The Effective Executive,The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done,Peter F. Drucker,Philosopher's Notes,"Peter Drucker is considered the father of modern management. This book was originally published in 1967. It‚Äôs *remarkably* well written and lucid. And, of course, packed with Big Ideas on how to optimize our effectiveness. We cover the 5 key practices/habits of the effective executive: time (first things first; second things never!), contribution (what can you contribute?), strengths (make yours productive; make weaknesses irrelevant), concentration (the secret to effectiveness), decisions (boundary conditions help)."
Leadership,Principles,Life and Work,Ray Dalio,Philosopher's Notes,"Ray Dalio is one of the most successful people alive. In fact, Time magazine says that he‚Äôs one of the 100 most influential people on the planet while Fortune magazine tells us his company (Bridgewater Associates) is the 5th most impactful private company in the U.S. and Forbes tells us that he‚Äôs one of the 100 wealthiest people on the planet. All of which makes Dalio, to use his words, ‚Äúbelievable‚Äù when it comes to discussing how to get what we want in life and work. Enter: Principles. Big Ideas we explore: how to evolve, what‚Äôs most important, meet the shapers, Principles #1 (Embrace reality and deal with it) + #2 (5-Step process to getting what you want in life), and the two AI‚Äôs: Artificial Intelligence + Ancient Intelligence."
Leadership,Sea Stories,My Life in Special Operations,Admiral William H. McRaven,Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book immediately after finishing Admiral McRaven‚Äôs first book, Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life... And Maybe the World. That one‚Äôs a quick-reading little book on the ten lessons McRaven learned in his SEAL training that we can all apply to our modern lives. It was fantastic. I had a strong feeling this memoir on his ‚ÄúLife in Special Operations‚Äù would be just as good. It is. As per the back cover, ‚ÄúAdmiral William H. McRaven is a part of American military history, having been involved in some of the most famous missions in recent memory, including the capture of Saddam Hussein, the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, and the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.‚Äù McRaven is a brilliant story teller with, as you can imagine, an incredible array of stories to tell. But that‚Äôs not why I loved this book so much. I loved it because reading it made me want to be a better human being. If you enjoy autobiographies and appreciate the military heroes who serve our country as much as I do, I think you‚Äôll love the book as much as I did."
Leadership,Learn How to Lead to Win,33 Powerful Stories and Leadership Lessons,Mike Manazir,Philosopher's Notes,"Mike Manazir (‚ÄúMuh-naw-zur‚Äù) is a Retired US Navy Admiral and Top Gun Fighter Pilot. I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a Commanding Officer in the US military (and a Heroic Coach). My friend recommended Jim Mattis‚Äôs book on leadership (Call Sign Chaos) and that book was so good that I asked him what *other* books on leadership he‚Äôd recommend. He immediately told me about this one. I immediately got it. Manazir was one of his cherished mentors. After reading this great book, I can see why. The book is, as you‚Äôd expect from the title, all about helping us learn how to lead to win. It‚Äôs part memoir, part leadership manual‚Äîfeaturing 33 powerful stories from Admiral Manazir‚Äôs life and the lessons he gained along the way. It reminds me of another memoir by another Navy Admiral I admire: Admiral William McRaven‚Äôs Sea Stories. In fact, as I type that, I realize that this book is kinda like a hybrid of McRaven‚Äôs memoir AND his latest book called The Hero Code. Mash those two books up and swap out the SEAL stories for a Top Gun Fighter Pilot‚Äôs and voil√†‚Äîyou get this book. As you‚Äôd expect, the book is PACKED with Big Ideas. I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorites so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"

Leadership,It Worked for Me,In Life and Leadership,General Colin L.

He served four presidential administrations in a variety of roles, most recently as Secretary of State from 2001 to 2005. In this great book, he shares the wisdom he gained that, as per the title, worked for him in life and leadership. It's fantastic. Big Ideas we explore include a super-quick look at his Thirteen Rules, the power of perpetual optimism (it's a force multiplier!), starting with ""It can be done"" (but making sure we're optimists and not stupid :), entering the Zone of Calm (essential for a leader), the fact that good leaders know that good plans are revised immediately, and how to deal with fear and failure."
Leadership,Louder than Words,Harness the Power of Your Authentic Voice,Todd Henry,Philosopher's Notes,"Todd Henry tells us that history‚Äôs most impactful humans all had a unique, powerful, authentic voice.

Robert Cialdini is a professor of both psychology and marketing at Arizona State University. He‚Äôs one of the world‚Äôs leading experts on the psychology of persuasion. The book is simultaneously kind of a consumer protection guide (how not to be duped) AND a manual for marketers (how to sell your stuff!). Cialdini has identified six core psychological principles of persuasion. We take a quick look at each, how they can be used for good or ill and how to apply the wisdom to our lives today."

Focus,Conquering Digital Addiction 101,,,101 Classes,"‚Äã‚ÄãTechnology is, obviously, awesome. We‚Äôve been using ‚Äútech‚Äù tools for 2.5 million years since our protohuman ancestors first picked up a stone and used it as a tool. 1.8 million years ago, ‚Äúwe‚Äù figured out how to make an acheulean hand axe which was a pretty epic innovation at the time. ‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚ÄãSo, with the advent of smartphones in what‚Äôs known as the ‚ÄúInput Age,‚Äù I‚Äôm not suggesting we should all become tech-smashing Luddites. But‚Ä¶ (And this is a big but!), I also don‚Äôt think we should underestimate just how much we play the role of addicted users caught up in the mix of a $7 TRILLION attention economics (/mind-hacking!) industry. ‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚ÄãThe solution: Become Optimizites‚Äîuse technology wisely to become the BEST you rather than mindlessly let your 1 million-year-old prefrontal cortex get hacked all day every day. ‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚ÄãIn the class, we walk through the costs of addiction, then talk about how to conquer it so we can sculpt our ideal lives."
Focus,Focus,The Hidden Driver of Excellence,Daniel Goleman,Philosopher's Notes,"Daniel Goleman is a former New York Times science writer and author of the uber-bestselling book Emotional Intelligence.

Although the book is called ‚ÄúHyperfocus,‚Äù it‚Äôs ultimately about learning how to control our attention‚Äîturning it on AND off at will as we master the process of intentionally entering what Chris calls ‚ÄúHyperfocus‚Äù (think: getting things done/being present mode) AND what he calls ‚ÄúScatterfocus‚Äù (deliberately allowing our minds to wander to enter creative mode). As per the inside flap, it‚Äôs ‚Äúa practical guide to managing your attention‚Äîthe most powerful resource you have to become more creative, get stuff done, and live a meaningful life.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include defining Hyperfocus, establishing how to get into it (including the #1 rule!), the power of specific implementation intentions (vs. ""vague"" intentions) and how to expand our productivity potential."
Focus,Black Hole Focus,How Intelligent People Can Create a Powerful Purpose for Their Lives,Isaiah Hankel,Philosopher's Notes,"Black holes. Just contemplating the sheer, fierce power of them is awe-inspiring, eh? Isaiah Hankel tells us that although physicists used to think that everything got destroyed in a black hole, now they believe that it‚Äôs less about destruction and more about *transformation.* And shines some light on the power of focusing on our purpose with black hole intensity. Big Ideas we explore include sheep vs. strategists, figuring out your ikigai (= why you get up in the morning), the fascinating endurance of rats with hope, the first two steps in greatness and moving from vision to decision."
Focus,Fully Engaged,Using the Practicing Mind in Daily Life,Thomas M. Sterner,Philosopher's Notes,"Thomas Sterner wrote the great book The Practicing Mind (see Notes).

Jake had worked on Gmail and JZ on YouTube before they connected at Google Ventures. While there, they worked with a ton of startups in which Google invested (including Uber, Slack and 23andMe) on a project-development system they created called ‚ÄúSprint.‚Äù This book is all about resetting our culture‚Äôs default settings by stepping off of what they call ‚Äúthe Busy Bandwagon‚Äù while jumping out of ‚ÄúInfinity Pools‚Äù of distraction to optimize our energy, focus, and time. It‚Äôs a GREAT book that echoes a ton of what we talk about all the time.

He‚Äôs one of the best endurance coaches ever and has been advocating a fat-burning approach to ultra-endurance for decades. The sub-title to this book captures the essence of all his work perfectly: ‚ÄúHow to Achieve Your Athletic Potential, Stay Healthy and Get the Most Out of Your Body.‚Äù This ""Endurance Handbook"" is basically an abridged version of ""The Big Book of Endurance."" As I was shining a flash light into all the nooks and crannies of Maffetone‚Äôs brain that I could find (hah), I kinda thought of these two books as a sort of parallel to Epictetus‚Äôs ""Discourses"" (the ‚ÄúBig Book‚Äù!) and ""Enchiridion"" (the ‚ÄúHandbook‚Äù!).

He‚Äôs coached everyone from the best triathlete in history (Mark Allen) to some of the best race car drivers (like the Andretti brothers). He even toured with The Red Hot Chilli Peppers as their wellness coach and helped Rick Rubin Optimize his life. This book is a fun look at Maffetone‚Äôs perspective on how to go about breaking the elusive 2-hour marathon. As he says in the sub-title, it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúhow it will go down‚Äù AND ‚Äúwhat it can teach all runners about training and racing.‚Äù If you‚Äôre a marathoner, this might be the perfect way to get introduced to Maffetone‚Äôs core ideas. I loved it as another way to drill Maffetone‚Äôs core ideas into my mind and training methodology. It‚Äôs basically a holistic look at all the marginal gains we can apply to reach our running potential. Big Ideas we cover include a quick look at just how fast a 1:59 pace is (sub-4:35 min mile for 26.2 miles = CRAZY fast!), the importance of the MIND in hitting the target, why AEROBIC speed is so important (plus, what it is and how to train it), the ideal training schedule (is super dynamic and personal), how to run properly (hot coal technique!), and balancing the catabolic + anabolic phases of training."

In the next Olympics in 1976, Lanny won the gold and then began teaching his ‚ÄúMental Management System¬Æ.‚Äù Since then, he‚Äôs coached Olympic teams from all around the world and has also worked with the Navy SEALs, Fortune 500 businesses, the PGA and its players and other elite performers in sports and business.

I‚Äôm a big fan of Michael Beckwith. In fact, Alexandra and I used to go to his Agape Spiritual Center in Santa Monica shortly after we got together 15+ years ago. I recently worked on a bunch of Notes on Yogananda‚Äôs books. Beckwith reminds me of him. He also reminds me of the old-school New Thought leaders whose torches he carries in his own unique way‚Äîincluding Ernest Holmes who founded the Science of Mind churches into which Beckwith was originally ordained. And, of course, any book on the spirituality of prosperity makes me think of Eric Butterworth and his Spiritual Economics (and Discover the Power Within You).

In this one, we ""zoom in on the here and now"" as we take a look at 21 of the most important things to be thinking about in the 21st century. Like all of his books, this is a thoughtful and thought-provoking look at some globally Big Ideas. Although obviously outside the scope of our normal Optimizing, I think it's important stuff. In the Note we explore dealing with ""Disillusionment"" (the title of chapter #1) by switching from ""panic to bewilderment""), the future of health care and driving (and jobs!), making sure we match our investment in developing AI with an equivalent investment in developing ""human consciousness,"" what we should be teaching our kids (basically, how to Optimize!!), and Yuval's #1 practice: meditation."

He‚Äôs a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Investigator in Health Policy Research at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. In this book, we take up the case against sugar as the primary suspect for ALL of the chronic diseases that are killing us. As the back cover says, Taubes ‚Äúmakes the convincing case that sugar is the tobacco of the new millennium: backed by powerful lobbies, entrenched in our lives, and making us very sick.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include: the prime suspect (= sugar), drug or food?, two theories (energy balance vs. metabolic theory), sugar as a chronic toxin (vs. acute), sugar as candy for cancer cells, and the big question: how little is too much?"

Phinney",Philosopher's Notes,"Jeff Volek and Stephen Phinney are two of the leading academic researchers who have been studying the efficacy of ketogenic diets for decades (a combined 50+ years between the two of them). Phinney actually coined the hyphenated word-phrase ‚Äúketo-adapted‚Äù to describe the process that typically takes at least 2 weeks to go from burning primarily sugar for fuel to burning primarily fat for fuel. In addition to being brilliant, iconoclastic, contrarian scientists (my favorite kind), Volek and Phinney are also funny. In this book they walk us through the SCIENCE behind why a well-formulated (‚Üê IMPORTANT distinction!) low-carbohydrate approach works. If that‚Äôs your thing, I think you‚Äôll dig it. Big Ideas we explore include: Who invented low-carb?

He‚Äôs a fascinating, iconoclastic guy who‚Äôs been preaching the power of burning fat for fuel for FOUR decades‚Äîdemonstrating that it‚Äôs not only an optimal approach to endurance fitness but to our optimal health as well. In this book, Phil focuses his big brain on what he calls the ‚Äúoverfat‚Äù pandemic. He uses the word ‚Äúoverfat‚Äù to describe people who have ‚Äúexcess body fat sufficient to impair health.‚Äù Overweight and obese people fall into this category. AND... Even people at a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù weight can be overfat. In fact, according to his research, 90% (!!!) of Americans fall into the ‚Äúoverfat‚Äù category. (Yikes!) We'll take a quick look at why we should care, figure out if we (and/or our loved ones) are overfat, look at the #1 cause and then focus on the solution so we can become optimalfat! :)"

As Dr. Panda tells us: ‚ÄúThe Circadian Code is a revolution in the way you think about diet, exercise, work, learning, and technology. Instead of counting calories or limiting food choices, you will learn that there is a right time to eat so that you can actually burn calories while you sleep. There is also a best time of day to exercise, to work, and to rest. Your body already knows this code: you just have to become aware of it and then follow its rhythm.‚Äù I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorite Big Ideas so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"

This book is a fun look at Maffetone‚Äôs perspective on how to go about breaking the elusive 2-hour marathon. As he says in the sub-title, it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúhow it will go down‚Äù AND ‚Äúwhat it can teach all runners about training and racing.‚Äù If you‚Äôre a marathoner, this might be the perfect way to get introduced to Maffetone‚Äôs core ideas. I loved it as another way to drill Maffetone‚Äôs core ideas into my mind and training methodology. It‚Äôs basically a holistic look at all the marginal gains we can apply to reach our running potential. Big Ideas we cover include a quick look at just how fast a 1:59 pace is (sub-4:35 min mile for 26.2 miles = CRAZY fast!), the importance of the MIND in hitting the target, why AEROBIC speed is so important (plus, what it is and how to train it), the ideal training schedule (is super dynamic and personal), how to run properly (hot coal technique!), and balancing the catabolic + anabolic phases of training."
Fitness,The Endurance Handbook,"How to Achieve Athletic Potential, Stay Healthy, and Get the Most Out of Your Body",Dr. Philip Maffetone,Philosopher's Notes,"Phil Maffetone is a brilliant, iconoclastic philosopher-coach. He‚Äôs one of the best endurance coaches ever and has been advocating a fat-burning approach to ultra-endurance for decades. The sub-title to this book captures the essence of all his work perfectly: ‚ÄúHow to Achieve Your Athletic Potential, Stay Healthy and Get the Most Out of Your Body.‚Äù This ""Endurance Handbook"" is basically an abridged version of ""The Big Book of Endurance."" As I was shining a flash light into all the nooks and crannies of Maffetone‚Äôs brain that I could find (hah), I kinda thought of these two books as a sort of parallel to Epictetus‚Äôs ""Discourses"" (the ‚ÄúBig Book‚Äù!) and ""Enchiridion"" (the ‚ÄúHandbook‚Äù!). Big Ideas we explore include Rule #1 (first, do no harm!), Rule #2 (build your aerobic base!), the importance of fat burning (and how to build it), the #1 pro tip (ELIMINATE SUGAR!!!), body economy 101 (uncapping your athletic potential), and winning the ultimate endurance race: life (see you at 100!)."
Fitness,The Overfat Pandemic,Exposing the Problem and Its Simple Solution for Everyone Who Needs to Eliminate Excess Body Fat,Dr. Philip Maffetone,Philosopher's Notes,"Phil Maffetone is one of the world‚Äôs all-time great endurance coaches. In addition to coaching the best triathlete ever (Mark Allen), he‚Äôs also toured with The Red Hot Chili Peppers as their wellness coach (he considers them endurance athletes) and he‚Äôs coached legendary music producer Rick Rubin‚Äîhelping him Optimize and lose over 100 pounds in the process. He‚Äôs a fascinating, iconoclastic guy who‚Äôs been preaching the power of burning fat for fuel for FOUR decades‚Äîdemonstrating that it‚Äôs not only an optimal approach to endurance fitness but to our optimal health as well. In this book, Phil focuses his big brain on what he calls the ‚Äúoverfat‚Äù pandemic. He uses the word ‚Äúoverfat‚Äù to describe people who have ‚Äúexcess body fat sufficient to impair health.‚Äù Overweight and obese people fall into this category. AND... Even people at a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù weight can be overfat. In fact, according to his research, 90% (!!!) of Americans fall into the ‚Äúoverfat‚Äù category. (Yikes!) We'll take a quick look at why we should care, figure out if we (and/or our loved ones) are overfat, look at the #1 cause and then focus on the solution so we can become optimalfat! :)"
Fitness,Fix Your Feet,"Build the Best Foundation for Healthy, Pain-Free Knees, Hips, and Spine",Dr. Philip Maffetone,Philosopher's Notes,"Let‚Äôs talk about our feet! Our feet? YES! Our feet. Although pretty much ignored, they‚Äôre kinda important. In fact, they are, of course, literally (!) the foundation of our entire body. And, we only get one pair that needs to last our whole life so... Get this: Over 25% of our bones are found in our feet. And, did you know that each foot endures over 100,000 (!!) pounds of pressure with every mile we walk? Yep. Why should we care? Because a bunch of our biomechanical issues‚Äîfrom sore knees and hips and lower backs‚Äîcan be traced back to sub-optimal feet. Enter: Fix Your Feet. We'll take a quick look at the #1 cause of foot problems along with the #1 solution plus some other goodness to make sure your feet (and the rest of you!) are smiling."
Fitness,The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing,,Dr. Philip Maffetone,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our second Note on one of Phil Maffetone‚Äôs books. This is called ‚ÄúThe Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing‚Äù for a reason. It‚Äôs a REALLY Big Book. (Hah!) It‚Äôs 516 pages, but the small font and two-column pages make it considerably denser; like, encyclopedically dense‚Äîwhich I found fantastic as I wanted to get into every nook and cranny of Phil‚Äôs brain. (Studying it was a wonderful mental-endurance workout. :) It‚Äôs essentially the distillation of over three decades (!) of clinical work with the world‚Äôs absolute best endurance athletes. Big Ideas we explore include the ""Big Four"" of the Big Book, the difference between aerobic and anaearobic (it's not just about oxygen!), building your superchargers (aka your mitochondria), flipping the switch to fat burning (pro tip: eliminate sugar and flour!), and stress: the good, the bad and the ugly (remember: training = work + rest!)."

Phinney",Philosopher's Notes,"Jeff Volek and Stephen Phinney are both academic researchers and professors who have been studying sports nutrition, ketogenic diets and peak performance for decades. To put it in perspective, Dr. Stephen Phinney (with his MD from Stanford and PhD from MIT) coined the phrase ‚Äúketo-adapted‚Äù in 1980. Big Ideas we explore include: the accepted dogma (vs. compelling data), two fuel tanks (you want to go hours or days?), veto-adaptation (how to), protein (necessary but in moderation), fat (your most important fuel; the good and bad!), and the macro breakdown (here it is!)."

Breathing,Optimal Breathing 101,,,101 Classes,"Breathing. It‚Äôs easy to take for granted but when you stop to think about it, it quickly becomes obvious just how powerful it is. Get this: You can live for weeks without food and days without water but, of course, only minutes without oxygen. Plus: Your brain uses 20% of the oxygen you consume while breathing is responsible for 70% (!) of your body‚Äôs detoxification. Yet‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre like most people, you‚Äôre probably doing this simple, should-be-easy fundamental wrong.

This book is a collection of articles that appeared in Yogananda‚Äôs magazines in the 1920s and 1930s. Yogananda reminds me of an Indian, often more spiritual version of old-school Western teachers like Orison Swett Marden, James Allen, Ernest Holmes, Dale Carnegie, and Napoleon Hill. If you‚Äôre interested in seeing what a yogi who inspired Steve Jobs has to say about success, I think you might enjoy the book as much as I did."
Prosperity,"Prosperity, Plenitude & Infinite Possibilities",,Michael Bernard Beckwith,Philosopher's Notes,"This is the second Note we‚Äôve done on one of Michael Beckwith‚Äôs books. Our first Note is on his great book Spiritual Liberation. I got this little booklet in a very big box of books the team sent me (thanks, Jana!) based on recommendations from our community. I‚Äôm a big fan of Michael Beckwith. In fact, Alexandra and I used to go to his Agape Spiritual Center in Santa Monica shortly after we got together 15+ years ago. I recently worked on a bunch of Notes on Yogananda‚Äôs books. Beckwith reminds me of him. He also reminds me of the old-school New Thought leaders whose torches he carries in his own unique way‚Äîincluding Ernest Holmes who founded the Science of Mind churches into which Beckwith was originally ordained. And, of course, any book on the spirituality of prosperity makes me think of Eric Butterworth and his Spiritual Economics (and Discover the Power Within You). This is a TINY little booklet that is based on the live transcript of a class Beckwith taught and ‚Äúis designed as a prayer, reference, practice and activation manual.‚Äù I hesitated to do a Note on it. But... It‚Äôs packed with Big Ideas that will provide a great springboard for us to connect to wisdom from other Notes I‚Äôve created over the years so here we are. LET'S GO!"

Creativity,Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t,And Other Tough-Love Truths to Make You a Better Writer,Steven Pressfield,Philosopher's Notes,"When I first saw the title for this book I thought to myself, ‚ÄúReally, Steve? THIS is what you think I need to hear? That nobody wants to read my sh*t? I thought we were working on our Resistance and winning the War of Art!"" Then I bought the book and embraced the tough love with a growth mindset. Big Ideas we explore include WHY people don't want to read your sh*t (or engage with your product/or listen to your talk, etc.) (hint: they're REALLY BUSY!), how to be worthy of their attention, why the hero's journey is essential for effective storytelling (the 10 main points), doing what scares you the most, and the importance of giving us your gift (mine the gold, please!!)."

Creativity,Dr. Seuss & Mr. Geisel,A Biography,"Judith Morgan, Neil Morgan",Philosopher's Notes,"Dr. Seuss & Mr. Geisel. We all know Dr. Seuss. But few of us know Mr. Geisel. I got this book as a gift from my friend (Zac Zeitlin) after our families enjoyed a hike together during which we chatted about my love of Mister Rogers and the documentary featuring him: Won‚Äôt You Be My Neighbor? Our conversation turned to another one of the most iconoclastic and influential luminaries of the 20th century: Dr. Seuss. Zac told me that this biography was one of his all-time favorites. After reading it, I can see why. It‚Äôs a remarkably endearing biography by Judith and Neil Morgan who knew Ted Geisel in the latter half of his life. Big Ideas we explore include the fact that Ted was voted LEAST likely to succeed (and then became the MOST successful of his Dartmouth class :), how to move through walls of rejection, the cat jumping out of the hat (an origin story), money (and joy), and Ted's admonition that we CAN and we've GOT TO do better than this."
Creativity,The Icarus Deception,How High Will You Fly?,Seth Godin,Philosopher's Notes,"Seth Godin is one of the world's most inspiring and prolific creators. He's also one of its most popular bloggers. This book is all about challenging what Seth calls ""The Icarus Deception"" and reclaiming our power to fly. The primary theme? We‚Äôre way too worried about exhibiting any level of hubris and trying to fly too high when we should be more concerned about flying too LOW. (Obviously, without being ‚Äúrecklessly stupid‚Äù about it but‚Ä¶) Big Ideas we explore include: how to catch a fox (and human!), the highs and lows of the Icarus Deception, ""the itch"" (how's yours?), and how to deal with resistance (aka ""the most important line in the book""!)."
Creativity,Running Down a Dream,Your Roadmap to Winning Creative Battles,Tim Grahl,Philosopher's Notes,"Tim Grahl is one of the world‚Äôs leading book-launch marketing gurus. To put it in perspective: At one point, his clients held FIVE spots on the New York Times bestseller lists. (To be clear: That‚Äôs REALLY (!!) hard to do. Like, almost impossible.) But get this: That week when he achieved the pinnacle of success? He was miserable. And this book is his inspiring, super-vulnerable story of how he moved through many dark nights of the soul as he ran down his dream‚Äîto not only create a business and body of work that he‚Äôs proud of but, much more importantly, a LIFE of sustainable meaning and mojo and joy. Big Ideas we cover include: a practice to eliminate the nonessential, the fact that everyone is pretty much always (!) editing their lives, making it all one big experiment, scraping away the plaster to reveal your already-perfect Golden Buddha essence and the true joy of running down your dream!"
Creativity,JAY-Z,Made in America,Michael Eric Dyson,Philosopher's Notes,"Michael Eric Dyson is one of America‚Äôs premier public intellectuals and the author of a number of New York Times bestselling books.

I really enjoyed the book for a number of reasons. First, Michael is a brilliant, captivating writer. Second, JAY-Z is an equally brilliant, captivating subject for Michael‚Äôs analysis. And, finally, as a white man trying to open my eyes to the realities of the racial issues in our culture, I found this book to be a perfect opportunity to deepen my perspective while appreciating two genius artists at work. If that sounds like fun, I think you‚Äôll enjoy the book as much as I did."
Creativity,Wired to Create,Unraveling the Mysteries of the Creative Mind,"Scott Barry Kaufman, Carolyn Gregoire",Philosopher's Notes,"This book started out as a blog post by Carolyn Gregoire based on Scott Barry Kaufman‚Äôs work that went viral: 18 Things Highly Creative People Do Differently. Scott is one of the world‚Äôs leading creativity researchers. Carolyn is a senior writer at the Huffington Post. Together, they wrote a great little book on the mysteries of the creative mind. Big Ideas we explore include: the fact that creativity is a messy business (embrace complexity!), the power of walking for daydreaming (all the cool philosophers do it!), creating a nice home for your genius to visit (she‚Äôs got the magic!), creating again and again (and again), unitask rather than multitask (unless you want to atrophy the best part of your brain), and STAMP your life with your own personality (but only if you want to be great ‚Ä¶ and happy!)."

Creativity,Lead Yourself First,Inspiring Leadership Through Solitude,"Raymond M. Kethledge, Michael S. Erwin",Philosopher's Notes,"Solitude. It‚Äôs the secret sauce to leadership. But... In their great book Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin tells us: ‚ÄúSolitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction. Like a great wave that saturates everything in its path, however, handheld devices and other media now leave us awash with the thoughts of others. We are losing solitude without even realizing it.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include the big 4 of solitude (clarity + creativity + emotional balance + moral courage), the threats from our ""Input Age,"" how MLK and Eisenhower used solitude, FOMO (get over it!) and how to change the world (starting with YOU!)."
Creativity,Daily Rituals,How Artists Work,Mason Currey,Philosopher's Notes,"If you‚Äôve ever wondered how some of the greatest mind‚Äôs in history‚Äîfrom poets, painters, and philosophers to playwrights, scientists and mathematicians‚Äîstructured their lives to get their great work done then this may just be the book for you. Mason Currey does a great job of providing super concise and equally fascinating portraits of the idiosyncratic habits of 161 (!) iconoclasts ranging from W.H. Auden, Charles Darwin and Carl Jung to Stephen King, Benjamin Franklin and Mozart. The variety of approaches is inspiring and, more than anything (for me), feels like a permission slip to *really* (unapologetically!) own my own idiosyncratic style. If that sounds like fun, I think you‚Äôll love the book as much as I did."

As they say, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúPart instruction manual, part someone else‚Äôs diary.‚Äù If you‚Äôre looking for some simple, practical ideas and inspiring examples of how to Optimize your mornings I think you‚Äôll dig it, too. Big Ideas we explore include how to avoid decision fatigue, what NOT to do if you want awesome routines (and to avoid reducing your IQ by 10 points), 5 tips for focused and productive mornings, your life as an experiment (with you as observer and subject) and evening routines (remember: tomorrow begins tonight!)"

Creativity,Art and Fear,Observations On the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking,"David Bayles, Ted Orland",Philosopher's Notes,"Art and fear. (You may have noticed they go together.) This is a quick-reading (122 pages), witty, real look at the process and challenges of making art. Of course, I think the biggest art project all of us can ever engage in is the creation of our own optimized and actualized lives, so we‚Äôll be focusing on Big Ideas we can apply to our lives today including: quitting vs. stopping, fast vs. slow, 50 lbs, the importance of progress, naive passion vs. informed passion and how to get work done like a PRO!"

This book is a distillation of the wisdom they taught in their popular Stanford University continuing studies course ‚ÄòFail Fast, Fail Often.‚Äù After working with thousands of people, they came to a compelling conclusion: ‚ÄúHappy and successful people tend to spend less time planning and more time acting‚Äù‚Äîwhich allows them to learn a TON and optimize along the way to mastery.

In this one, we ""zoom in on the here and now"" as we take a look at 21 of the most important things to be thinking about in the 21st century. Like all of his books, this is a thoughtful and thought-provoking look at some globally Big Ideas. Although obviously outside the scope of our normal Optimizing, I think it's important stuff. In the Note we explore dealing with ""Disillusionment"" (the title of chapter #1) by switching from ""panic to bewilderment""), the future of health care and driving (and jobs!), making sure we match our investment in developing AI with an equivalent investment in developing ""human consciousness,"" what we should be teaching our kids (basically, how to Optimize!!), and Yuval's #1 practice: meditation."

Learning,Homo Deus,A Brief History of Tomorrow,Yuval Noah Harari,Philosopher's Notes,"Yuval Noah Harari is a brilliant historian and thinker.

While Sapiens features a ‚ÄúA Brief History of Humankind,‚Äù Homo Deus gives us ‚ÄúA Brief History of Tomorrow.‚Äù Wonder what the future might look like and how artificial intelligence and biotechnology will fundamentally change the world and our species? Well, this is the book for you. It‚Äôs incredibly well-written and thoughtful and thought provoking. I HIGHLY recommend it.

It‚Äôs a wonderfully written book by Dava Sobel, who combines her background in both astronomy and psychology to give us a behind-the-scenes look at the science and history of time, longitude, and seafaring all wrapped up in one epic heroic quest. If you‚Äôre looking for a fun, quick-reading, mind-expanding escape from the normal self-development literature, I think you‚Äôll enjoy this hero-tale as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include: clocks and watches (and SUNDIALS!), time (as measured in heartbeats), longitude (vs. latitude), strengths (and weaknesses), encouraging a hero (how will you do so Today?!), Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day (neither was anything awesome), elegant solutions (and the scientific establishment)."

Learning,The Art of Peace,,Morihei Ueshiba,Philosopher's Notes,"Morihei Ueshiba was one of the world's greatest martial artists and the founder of Aikido.

Learning,The Genius in All of Us,"New Insights into Genetics, Talent, and IQ",David Shenk,Philosopher's Notes,"David Shenk is the award-winning and national-bestselling author of six books. He‚Äôs also a lecturer and filmmaker. His primary focus with this book is shining a bright light on the fact that the ‚ÄúNature vs. Nurture‚Äù paradigm is a VERY limited way of looking at things. He tells us that the interaction between our genes and our environment is a much more nuanced, DYNAMIC PROCESS. Big Ideas we explore include Genes 1.0 vs. Genes 2.0 (think G+E vs. GxE), the Mozart Myth (remember: Talent is overrated!), deliberate practice (is where it's at), and how to be a genius (or merely great)."

Then we create a game to put the new you into action by WOOPing your WIG and WINning while creating Antifragile Confidence + Buoyancy (science says = Levity + Gravity) while rocking our affirmations and affirmaction and remembering Other Image 101 as well."
Self-Image,The Alter Ego Effect,The Power of Secret Identities to Transform Your Life,Todd Herman,Philosopher's Notes,"The Alter Ego Effect. This is one of the most fun and compelling and inspiring books I‚Äôve read in awhile.

We featured another one of his books called Spiritual Economics. That one transformed my consciousness around money/ambition/etc. (I *highly* recommend it.) Butterworth was also Maya Angelou's spiritual teacher. And, Oprah says that this book is one of her all-time favorites.

He was commander of Task Unit Bruiser‚Äïthe most decorated Special Operations Unit of the Iraq War. I really enjoyed Jocko‚Äôs first book Extreme Ownership and I knew this one would be good but... I didn‚Äôt expect it to be THIS good. The words literally explode off the page. Not just because each micro-chapter was an incredibly inspiring micro-manifesto but because each word was written by a man so clearly living in complete integrity with his deepest values. John Maxwell would say his ‚Äúmoral authority‚Äù is extraordinary. I‚Äôd say his SOUL FORCE is palpable. If you‚Äôre in the mood for a soul-rattling call-to-disciplined action, I think you‚Äôll enjoy the book as much as I did."

Oettingen walks us thru the compelling research that demonstrates the power of seeing both the positive AND the challenges. When we contrast our wishes with the obstacles to their attainment we, almost magically, catalyze an extraordinarily higher level of performance."

Well, Heidi Grant Halvorson, the young Positive Psychology superstar, gives you the goods in this awesome book. You might be surprised by what you learn.

He‚Äôs a great writer and distills the essence of habit formation into, well, its fundamental components‚Äîthe ‚Äúatomic‚Äù structure if you will‚Äîwhile showing us how those TINY little incremental improvements add up to MIGHTY results. I rarely say a book is a must-read but this one‚Äôs as close as it gets. Big Ideas we explore include: The math behind 1% gains compounding over a year (and a decade!), navigating the Plateau of Latent Potential (ever given up on a habit? Take note!), the importance (and etymology) of our Identity (get this: it *literally* means 'repeated being ness'), The 4 Laws of Behavior Change (remember: cue + craving + response + reward and... make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying), and the Sorites Paradox (can a single habit change your life?)."

I didn‚Äôt expect it to be THIS good. The words literally explode off the page.

This book is, as per the back cover, ‚Äúa clear-eyed account of learning to lead in a chaotic world‚Äù in which Mattis ‚Äúrecounts the foundational experiences and lessons he learned over four decades and in three wars. It is a journey about learning to lead at every level, with insights equally applicable to the military, to business, and to individual growth.‚Äù I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a long-time student (and Heroic Coach) who also happens to be a commanding officer in the U.S. military. It‚Äôs an absolutely FANTASTIC memoir packed with wisdom on how to lead‚Äîwhich is why it has nearly 5,000 5-star reviews. The book reminds me of two other memoirs by military leaders I admire: Admiral William McRaven‚Äôs Sea Stories and General Colin Powell‚Äôs It Worked for Me. It also reminds me of Phil Knight‚Äôs memoir Shoe Dog and Ray Dalio‚Äôs Principles. And... For related books on leadership, check out our Notes on General Stanley McChrystal‚Äôs Leaders: Myths and Reality plus Doris Kearns Goodwin‚Äôs Leadership in Turbulent Times. As you‚Äôd expect, this book is packed with Big Ideas. I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorites so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"
Military,Embrace the Suck,The Navy SEAL Way to an Extraordinary Life,Brent Gleeson,Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book (along with a dozen others!) after reading Admiral Manazir‚Äôs great book Learn How to Lead to Win. It‚Äôs a FANTASTIC, quick-reading, laugh-out-loud funny addition to our growing pantheon of Navy SEAL books. David Goggins wrote the foreword to the book. He and Brent were in the same SEAL class (235) and they both share a fondness for hard-hitting, no-nonsense wisdom delivered with an ample share of f-bombs. As you‚Äôd expect, the book is packed with Big Ideas. And, as always, I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorites so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"
Military,Learn How to Lead to Win,33 Powerful Stories and Leadership Lessons,Mike Manazir,Philosopher's Notes,"Mike Manazir (‚ÄúMuh-naw-zur‚Äù) is a Retired US Navy Admiral and Top Gun Fighter Pilot. I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a Commanding Officer in the US military (and a Heroic Coach). My friend recommended Jim Mattis‚Äôs book on leadership (Call Sign Chaos) and that book was so good that I asked him what *other* books on leadership he‚Äôd recommend. He immediately told me about this one. I immediately got it. Manazir was one of his cherished mentors. After reading this great book, I can see why. The book is, as you‚Äôd expect from the title, all about helping us learn how to lead to win. It‚Äôs part memoir, part leadership manual‚Äîfeaturing 33 powerful stories from Admiral Manazir‚Äôs life and the lessons he gained along the way. It reminds me of another memoir by another Navy Admiral I admire: Admiral William McRaven‚Äôs Sea Stories. In fact, as I type that, I realize that this book is kinda like a hybrid of McRaven‚Äôs memoir AND his latest book called The Hero Code. Mash those two books up and swap out the SEAL stories for a Top Gun Fighter Pilot‚Äôs and voil√†‚Äîyou get this book. As you‚Äôd expect, the book is PACKED with Big Ideas. I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorites so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"
Military,Leaders,Myth and Reality,"General (Ret.) Stanley McChrystal, Jeff Eggers, Jason Mangone",Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book after I saw General Stanley McChrystal‚Äôs blurb on the back of Ryan Holiday‚Äôs Lives of the Stoics. I read it in one 8.8-hour Deep Work-filled day. It‚Äôs fantastic. McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history‚Äôs most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there‚Äôs a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the ‚Äúmyths‚Äù of leadership and the MUCH MESSIER ‚Äúrealities‚Äù of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership. We end the book with the sober recognition of just how complex, dynamic and context-specific good leadership is. It‚Äôs a challenging, important book that‚Äôs difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership. So... Let‚Äôs get to work!"
Military,Fearless,The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown,Eric Blehm,Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book after my friend, retired Navy SEAL Captain Bob Schoultz, recommended it to me. It‚Äôs ASTONISHINGLY good. As per the sub-title, this book is about ""The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown."" It's a humbling, inspiring story ""of an American hero who bravely gave permission in his final written requests to share his journey, from small-town America to gutter to jail to Jesus to war to the top tier of the U.S. military: SEAL Team Six.‚Äù"
Military,Staring Down the Wolf,7 Leadership Commitments That Forge Elite Teams,Mark Divine,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our third Note on one of Mark Divine's books. Mark is a retired Navy SEAL Commander. He also has twenty-five years of experience as an entrepreneur. In this book, he draws on his decades of leadership experience to teach us the ""7 Leadership Commitments That Forge Elite Teams."" Big Ideas we explore include The Two Wolves (which one are YOU feeding?), the. 7 Commitments (Courage + Trust + Respect + Growth + Excellence + Resiliency + Alignment), Falling Down Seven Times (and getting back up eight), Semper Gumby (Always Flexible!), and Your #1 Fear to Stare Down Next (what's yours?)."
Military,Extreme Ownership,How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win,"Jocko Willink, Leif Babin",Philosopher's Notes,"Jocko Willink and Leif Babin were two of the most senior (and decorated) SEALS on the ground in the most intense battles of Iraq. In this book they share their leadership lessons on how U.S. Navy SEALs lead and win. It‚Äôs an intense, impactful read. Big Ideas we explore include a definition of Extreme Ownership, the fact that there are no bad teams, only bad leaders, how to prioritize and execute and remembering that discipline = freedom."
Military,Unstoppable Teams,The Four Essential Actions of High-Performance Leadership,Alden Mills,Philosopher's Notes,"Alden Mills is a three-time Navy SEAL platoon commander and the Founder/CEO of Perfect Fitness (which was one of Inc.‚Äôs fastest-growing companies in the country). He‚Äôs also the father of four boys, a great writer/storyteller and, most importantly, an inspiring human being. I loved Alden‚Äôs first book Be Unstoppable. This book (and the AMAZING Unstoppable Teams 101 class Alden created with us for our Optimizers!!) is packed with wisdom gleaned from Alden‚Äôs 25+ years of experience working with high-performing teams. It‚Äôs fantastic. Big Ideas we explore include a quick look at the CARE loop, the Whiner vs. the Whisperer (+ Samurai swords), The A in CARE, achieving over-the-horizon goals, and jumping headfirst into leading your unstoppable teams!"
Military,Can‚Äôt Hurt Me,Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,David Goggins,Philosopher's Notes,"David Goggins is a former Navy SEAL (and Army Ranger) who used to hold a Guinness World Record for completing 4,030 pull-ups in 17 hours. These days he‚Äôs setting records as an ultra-endurance athlete. But he wasn‚Äôt always Mr. Superhero. In this great autobiographical self-help book, David walks us through his transformation from being a 297-pound exterminator to a ‚ÄúWho IS this guy?!‚Äù superhero. If you‚Äôre into SUPER (!!!) intense demonstrations of how to conquer ourselves to do the seemingly impossible (and don‚Äôt mind a stream of f-bombs‚Äîlol) then I think you‚Äôll love this book as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include: The Accountability Mirror, bringing your best (when you feel the worst), hero callouses (let failures toughen you up!), the process (how to go from running 1/4 of a mile to 200+ nonstop), and bursting from the inside out (learn to endure!)."
Military,Sea Stories,My Life in Special Operations,Admiral William H. McRaven,Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book immediately after finishing Admiral McRaven‚Äôs first book, Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life... And Maybe the World. That one‚Äôs a quick-reading little book on the ten lessons McRaven learned in his SEAL training that we can all apply to our modern lives. It was fantastic. I had a strong feeling this memoir on his ‚ÄúLife in Special Operations‚Äù would be just as good. It is. As per the back cover, ‚ÄúAdmiral William H. McRaven is a part of American military history, having been involved in some of the most famous missions in recent memory, including the capture of Saddam Hussein, the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, and the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.‚Äù McRaven is a brilliant story teller with, as you can imagine, an incredible array of stories to tell. But that‚Äôs not why I loved this book so much. I loved it because reading it made me want to be a better human being. If you enjoy autobiographies and appreciate the military heroes who serve our country as much as I do, I think you‚Äôll love the book as much as I did."
Military,Make Your Bed,Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World,Admiral William H. McRaven,Philosopher's Notes,"Admiral William H. McRaven is a Retired U.S. Navy SEAL who served for thirty-seven years and commanded at every level. As a Four-Star Admiral, his final assignment was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces. (During this time, he oversaw the covert mission that killed Osama bin Laden.) In 2014, he gave the commencement address to the graduates of the University of Texas at Austin. Millions of people wound up watching his speech on ten lessons he learned from his Navy SEAL training. This book takes a deeper look at those ten lessons. It‚Äôs a super-quick read‚Äîpacked with simple, yet profound wisdom along with moving stories of moral exemplars. It's FANTASTIC."
Military,Be Unstoppable,The 8 Essential Actions to Succeed at Anything,Alden Mills,Philosopher's Notes,"This is a surprisingly awesome book‚Äîa fable about a young captain who spends time with a master and commander who reveals the secret code of rockin‚Äô it. It‚Äôs kinda like if a Navy SEAL wrote The Alchemist or The Way of the Peaceful Warrior or The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. Big Ideas we cover include: U.P.E.R.S.I.S.T. (the code to being unstoppable), the 2 limitations in life, how to discover your why, how to plan in 3-D, and the magic pill you need to take."

In their great book Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin tells us: ‚ÄúSolitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction. Like a great wave that saturates everything in its path, however, handheld devices and other media now leave us awash with the thoughts of others.

Douglass Brackmann got a dual PhD in 2002. Then he ‚Äústruck out to research the components of powerful thought and action, helping driven ‚Äòhunters‚Äô focus their gifts.‚Äù We explore the paradoxical truth of Optimizing and actualizing as a Driven person (hint: discipline equals freedom), the fact that you have a great story to write (and you need structures to channel your energy), the Mastery Mindset (how‚Äôs yours?), the reality that better has no finish line (that‚Äôs worth repeating: better has no finish line), you and your sword (forging time!), and the Mastery Path (you on it?)."

He served four presidential administrations in a variety of roles, most recently as Secretary of State from 2001 to 2005.

This is the 25th anniversary, fifth edition version of their best-selling classic that has sold over 2 million copies. One of the things I most like about this book is the fact that it covers the SCIENCE of leadership. Kouzes and Posner have been conducting empirical research for over three decades.

Big Ideas we explore include a quick look at our moral exemplars, moral agency, and the three virtues we want to cultivate: Truth + Humility + Faith."
Military,Grit,The Power of Passion and Perseverance,Angela Duckworth,Philosopher's Notes,"Angela Duckworth is the world‚Äôs leading authority on the science of grit.

Military,The Stoic Challenge,"A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient",William B. Irvine,Philosopher's Notes,"William B. Irvine is a professor of philosophy at Wright State University. He‚Äôs also a fantastic (and prolific) writer. And‚Ä¶ Unlike many of his academic, professor-of-philosophy peers, he is a practicing Stoic philosopher. In the words of Donald Robertson (another Stoic author and practitioner; see The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), he is both a librarian AND a warrior of the mind. We featured another one of Professor Irvine‚Äôs great books on Stoicism called A Guide to the Good Life. I enjoyed that one quite a bit but I REALLY (!) enjoyed this one. Like, jumbo loved it. In fact, I‚Äôm going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism‚Äîalong with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday‚Äôs The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic.

Military,The Stress Test,How Pressure Can Make You Stronger and Sharper,Ian Robertson,Philosopher's Notes,"Ian Robertson is a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist. He‚Äôs widely considered one of the world‚Äôs leading researchers in neuropsychology. This book is, essentially, a fascinating tour through his decades-long pursuit to scientifically test Nietzsche‚Äôs maxim ‚ÄúWhat doesn‚Äôt kill me, makes me stronger.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include the double-edge sword of stress (remember the Yerkes-Dodson Law and how to Optimize it!), the power of saying ""I feel excited!"" (rather than ""I feel anxious.""), the fact that a wandering mind is an UNHAPPY mind (crazy studio show it), Hall of Fame researching stats (note: failing nearly 70% of the time), and the power of BELIEVING we can use stress to get stronger (it ALL starts with belief)."
Military,The Upside of Stress,"Why Stress Is Good for You, and How to Get Good at It",Kelly McGonigal,Philosopher's Notes,"If you‚Äôve ever had stress in your life (hah!) and wondered how to deal with it more optimally, I think you‚Äôll love this. McGonigal tells us that how we THINK about stress plays a huge role in its affect on us and walks us thru the science behind it. Rather than try to get rid of stress (good luck with that!), we‚Äôre much better off shifting our mindsets to embrace and use the stress wisely!"
Military,The Champion's Comeback,"How Great Athletes Recover, Reflect, and Re-Ignite",Jim Afremow,Philosopher's Notes,"Jim Afremow is one of the world‚Äôs leading sports psychologists. We covered his first book The Champion‚Äôs Mind.

I read it in one 8.8-hour Deep Work-filled day. It‚Äôs fantastic. McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history‚Äôs most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there‚Äôs a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the ‚Äúmyths‚Äù of leadership and the MUCH MESSIER ‚Äúrealities‚Äù of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership.

It‚Äôs a challenging, important book that‚Äôs difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership.

In their great book Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin tells us: ‚ÄúSolitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction.

Big Ideas we explore include: defining ego, becoming more than a flash in the pan, finally answering the question of whether it takes 10,000 or 20,000 hours to attain mastery, the virtue and value of staying true to your own path and making it rather than faking it."
Public-Speaking,Daring Greatly,"How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead",Bren√© Brown,Philosopher's Notes,"Teddy Roosevelt told us that it's not the critic who counts.

Conquer-Cancer,Conquering Cancer 101,,,101 Classes,"My brother was recently diagnosed with cancer. As I wrapped my brain around how to best help him, I realized that, unfortunately (and obviously), our family is not alone in fighting cancer. Although we haven‚Äôt met (yet!), I consider you a friend and a part of our extended family. So, I created this class imagining myself supporting you and your family as your friend if you happen to be dealing with cancer like us. Big Ideas we explore include understanding the fact that our habits are more influential than our genes, the importance of an empowered mindset, and the nuts and bolts of what we scientifically know helps Optimize ‚Äúthe terrain‚Äù (from nutrition and movement to stress management and environmental toxins) to best prevent and fight cancer. I hope you enjoy and I‚Äôm sending love to you and your fam!"
Conquer-Cancer,Conquering Cancer 102,,,101 Classes,"In Conquering Cancer 101 we focused on the nuts-and-bolts of how to Optimize our terrain and make sure we‚Äôre cutting off cancer‚Äôs supply lines while getting our minds strong and aiming for the long tail, etc. Our primary source of inspiration for that class was Anticancer by David Servan-Schreiber and the dozens of references to cancer in other Notes over the years. In Conquering Cancer 102, we cover all the wisdom I‚Äôve picked up since that class over the last month. Theme: Rethinking Cancer: Theory + Therapy. Featuring Big Ideas from Tripping over the Truth (great intellectual overview of the history of cancer theory/therapy), The Metabolic Approach to Cancer (GREAT (!) practical roadmap on how to Optimize terrain by my brother‚Äôs new consulting oncologist), Cancer as a Metabolic Disease (by the leading research scientist on the approach we‚Äôre following), Keto for Cancer (by my brother‚Äôs day-to-day nutritional consultant), and Radical Remission (by a leading researcher on who‚Äôs studied 1,000+ case studies of people who have thrived outside of traditional approaches)."
Conquer-Cancer,The Metabolic Approach to Cancer,"Integrating Deep Nutrition, the Ketogenic Diet, and Nontoxic Bio-Individualized Therapies","Dr. Nasha Winters, Jess Higgins Kelley, MNT",Philosopher's Notes,"This is the third book specifically on cancer I got after my brother‚Äôs recent diagnosis. When I asked my friend (and coach) Ben Greenfield what books I should be reading he told me to read this one and to ‚Äúfollow it to the t.‚Äù So, of course, I immediately got it. It‚Äôs astonishingly good. I echo Ben‚Äôs advice and say, THIS is the book to read if you or a loved one are dealing with cancer. Dr. Nasha Winters was diagnosed with stage IV terminal ovarian cancer 25 years ago. She was given 3 to 6 months to live and was told Western medicine couldn‚Äôt do anything for her so she committed herself to figuring it out‚Äîbecoming a naturopathic doctor and acupuncturist and fellow of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology in the process. 25 years later (!) she‚Äôs thriving and has helped thousands of others thrive through cancer by focusing on, as per the title, a ‚Äúmetabolic approach to cancer‚Äù that integrates ‚Äúdeep nutrition, the ketogenic diet, and nontoxic bio-individualized therapies.‚Äù"
Conquer-Cancer,Anticancer,A New Way of Life,David Servan-Schreiber,Philosopher's Notes,"I got this book immediately after my older brother had a major surgery and was diagnosed with cancer. David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PhD, was a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and published more than ninety articles in scientific journals. David was diagnosed with brain cancer at 31 years old. At the time he was very skeptical of anything but the well-known, traditional Western therapeutic approaches. But, as he drilled into the scientific literature, he realized just how important Optimizing the ‚Äúterrain‚Äù within our bodies is to the prevention and treatment of cancer. This book is an overview of what he discovered. It‚Äôs incredibly thoughtful and thorough. Big Ideas we explore include Genes vs. Habits, cutting off cancer‚Äôs supply lines, the three keys to nutritional detox, the anticancer mind and the best protection against cancer."
Conquer-Cancer,Cancer as a Metabolic Disease - Book,"On the Origin, Management, and Prevention of Cancer",Thomas N. Seyfried,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our eight Note on cancer books. It‚Äôs also our second Note on Thomas Seyfried‚Äôs work. We started with the journal article also called ‚ÄúCancer as a metabolic disease.‚Äù Seyfried has taught and conducted research in the fields of neurogenetics, neurochemistry and cancer for more than twenty-five years at Yale University and Boston College. He is the leading scientist pointing to (and nearly screaming at!) the SUPER-compelling evidence that says cancer is caused by dysfunctional energy metabolism‚Äîproviding evidence that the genetic mutations are a secondary, downstream epiphenomenon of that primary cause. Big Ideas we explore include the metabolic theory vs. the genetic theory of cancer, nuclear-cytoplasm studies (perhaps the most powerful case for the metabolic theory), metastasis (Mr. Mo builds your MOAT!!), apoptotic vs. necrotic cell death (aka naturel/nontoxic vs. unnatural/toxic), and the cancer solar system (make sure the metabolic cancer-sun is in the discussion!)."
Conquer-Cancer,Cancer as a Metabolic Disease - Journal Article,Open Access Journal Article from Nutrition & Metabolism,"Thomas N. Seyfried, Laura Shelton",Philosopher's Notes,"This is our fourth Note specifically related to cancer I created after my brother‚Äôs diagnosis. The Note is on an open access article from the scientific journal Nutrition and Metabolism that Nasha Winters says is a ‚Äúmust read!‚Äù (I agree! Super compelling.) Thomas Seyfried is the leading research scientist making the case for the metabolic approach to cancer (vs. as we‚Äôve discussed, a genetic approach). He and Laura Shelton brilliantly and lucidly unpack the case for cancer as a metabolic disease. Bonus: Your brain gets a nice workout as every word is chosen wisely for peer-reviewable hardiness. Big Ideas we explore include the genes vs. metabolism discussion, why your mitochondria are so important, and the two key therapeutic responses if you believe the metabolic approach."
Conquer-Cancer,Radical Remission,Surviving Cancer Against All Odds,Kelly A. Turner,Philosopher's Notes,"This is the seventh Note we‚Äôve created on books specifically on cancer. Kelly Turner is one of the world‚Äôs leading researchers and psychotherapists in the field of integrative oncology. She got her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley (one of the best graduate programs out there) studying the remarkable stories of people who were told they had a limited amount of time to live and then RADICALLY defied those odds. In fact, she‚Äôs studied over 1,000 (!) case studies of what she calls ‚ÄúRadical Remission.‚Äù In the book, she shares the nine ‚Äúkey factors that can unlock your pathway to dramatic healing.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore: The definition of Radical Remission, the #1 key factor (hint: change your diet!), being a patient vs. a CONQUEROR, symptoms vs. systems, epigenetics, and identifying your reason for living."
Conquer-Cancer,Tripping over the Truth,How the Metabolic Theory of Cancer Is Overturning One of Medicine's Most Entrenched Paradigms,Travis Christofferson,Philosopher's Notes,"This is the second book specifically on cancer I‚Äôve read after my brother Rick was diagnosed with cancer. (The first book was Anticancer.) Travis Christofferson is a science writer. In this great book, he provides a compelling look at the history of scientific research on cancer and the traditional therapeutic models offered‚Äîjuxtaposing the (traditionally accepted) Somatic Mutation Theory (or SMT) with the (much more compelling) Metabolic Theory of Cancer. Big Ideas we explore include the fact that we‚Äôve spent $100 billion researching cancer and spend $100 billion annually on cancer medications and we‚Äôve seen ZERO improvements in the real death rates from cancer since the 1950s. We look at the one prime cause of cancer (via the Warburg Effect), a fascinating experiment with ‚Äúrecon‚Äù cells demonstrating that it's the cytoplasm (not the nucleus) that drives cancer, how to starve cancer and a vision of cancer clinics in the future."
Conquer-Cancer,Keto for Cancer,Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy as a Targeted Nutritional Strategy,Miriam Kalamian,Philosopher's Notes,"This is the fifth Note I've created specifically on cancer after my brother's diagnosis. Miriam Kalamian is one of the leading nutrition consultants focused on cancer. She helps people approach cancer with a therapeutic ketogenic diet. In fact, she's my brother's day-to-day nutritional consultant. She has been AMAZING. (And, given the fact that food is, ultimately, our most powerful medicine, in many ways I consider her our brother's primary care physician. :) People have asked what nutritional approach we're following. THIS is it. The book is PACKED with wisdom on, as the sub-title suggests ""Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy as a Targeted Nutritional Strategy."" Big Ideas we explore include: Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy 101, the basic plan, ""Diet doesn't matter"" - Your Oncologist | ""Yes, it does."" - Your Cancer, Boost + Ensure (eliminate to boost and ensure well-being), and the importance of measuring glucose and ketones daily."
Conquer-Cancer,Outside the Box Cancer Therapies,Alternative Therapies That Treat and Prevent Cancer,"Dr. Mark Stengler, N.M.D., Dr. Paul Anderson, N.M.D.",Philosopher's Notes,"This is the sixth book in our Conquering Cancer series. It‚Äôs a great overview of the importance of an integrative oncological approach written by two naturopathic medical doctors with over 40 years of combined clinical experience and a ton of experience researching and teaching these principles to other medical professionals and their patients. It‚Äôs almost encyclopedic in its analysis of ‚Äúoutside the box cancer therapies‚Äù and the kind of book you wish you could instantly download into your traditional oncologist‚Äôs brain for a quick introduction to how a powerful integrative approach works. Big Ideas we explore include defining ‚Äúintegrative oncology,‚Äù looking at the root causes of cancer (and integrating conflicting theories), the philosophy of integrative medicine, strategic considerations for your cancer plan and the importance of ‚Äúsecondary prevention.‚Äù"
Conquer-Cancer,The Truth in Small Doses,Why We‚Äôre Losing the War on Cancer‚Äîand How to Win It,Clifton Leaf,Philosopher's Notes,"This is the ninth Note on cancer we‚Äôve done so far. I picked this book up after Travis Christofferson referenced it a couple times in Tripping over the Truth. Clifton Leaf is a great writer and the Editor-in-Chief of Fortune magazine. He tells us that nine years before he wrote this book he began his reporting on cancer with a five-word question: How did we get here Specifically, Leaf wanted to know: How did we get to a point, 40+ years after Nixon declared War on Cancer, where the real death rate is, essentially, the same as it was in the 1950s? That‚Äôs a great question. And, he provides a powerful look at what‚Äôs gone wrong and how to fix it. Big Ideas we explore include the power of taking a different route to the summit, the truth (but only in small doses), dogma vs. science, the power of prevention, and the power of counting‚Äîaka, the truth in large doses."
Conquer-Cancer,The Emperor of All Maladies,A Biography of Cancer,Siddhartha Mukherjee,Philosopher's Notes,"This is the 10th book on cancer we‚Äôve featured so far since my brother‚Äôs cancer diagnosis. Although brilliantly written (Mukherjee won a Pulitzer for it), I didn‚Äôt start with this 570-page tome because, I read this book last because, frankly, I wasn‚Äôt interested in starting with a book that featured, as per the inside flap, ‚Äúcancer as the protagonist.‚Äù I wanted my BROTHER (and you and your loved ones) to star as the conqueror of cancer, not the other way around. Alas, frankly, this book was painful to read as Mukherjee is a devout follower of the ‚Äúcancer is a genetic disease‚Äù camp‚Äîwhich is why, from his vantage point, cancer looks unbeatable (and why, from my vantage point, we‚Äôre *losing* the War on Cancer). This Note is a little different than all the rest in that we‚Äôll take a critical look at the underlying premise of the book (i.e, that cancer is primarily a genetic disease) and present a way to conquer the emperor (by seeing cancer as a mitochondrial METABOLIC disease)."
Conquer-Cancer,Cancer-Fighting Mindset,,,+1s,"In our last +1, we talked about a super powerful way to keep your telomeres nice and long.

McGonigal tells us that how we THINK about stress plays a huge role in its affect on us and walks us thru the science behind it. Rather than try to get rid of stress (good luck with that!), we‚Äôre much better off shifting our mindsets to embrace and use the stress wisely!"

Conquer-Procrastination,A Mind for Numbers,How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra),"Barbara Oakley, Ph.D.",Philosopher's Notes,"Although, as per the sub-title, the book is ostensibly about ‚ÄúHow to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra),‚Äù it‚Äôs really about excelling at learning and at LIFE! Barbara Oakley is an award winning engineering teacher who used to struggle mightily with math and science. She walks us through the latest research in neuroscience and learning as she shares fascinating biographical sketches of scientific + mathematical luminaries along with wisdom from other world-class teachers. Great stuff."

Conquer-Procrastination,Loving What Is,Four Questions That Can Change Your Life,Byron Katie,Philosopher's Notes,"Byron Katie is best known for the four questions that make up ""The Work"" and in this Note we‚Äôll take a quick look at those along with some other really cool Ideas. We'll learn to love what is by seeing our suffering as a compassionate alarm clock awakening us to our possibilities and by recognizing that if we see things as ""wrong"" in the world, we need to start by changing our own consciousness."
Conquer-Procrastination,The Icarus Deception,How High Will You Fly?,Seth Godin,Philosopher's Notes,"Seth Godin is one of the world's most inspiring and prolific creators. He's also one of its most popular bloggers. This book is all about challenging what Seth calls ""The Icarus Deception"" and reclaiming our power to fly. The primary theme? We‚Äôre way too worried about exhibiting any level of hubris and trying to fly too high when we should be more concerned about flying too LOW. (Obviously, without being ‚Äúrecklessly stupid‚Äù about it but‚Ä¶) Big Ideas we explore include: how to catch a fox (and human!), the highs and lows of the Icarus Deception, ""the itch"" (how's yours?), and how to deal with resistance (aka ""the most important line in the book""!)."
Conquer-Procrastination,The Upside of Stress,"Why Stress Is Good for You, and How to Get Good at It",Kelly McGonigal,Philosopher's Notes,"If you‚Äôve ever had stress in your life (hah!) and wondered how to deal with it more optimally, I think you‚Äôll love this. McGonigal tells us that how we THINK about stress plays a huge role in its affect on us and walks us thru the science behind it. Rather than try to get rid of stress (good luck with that!), we‚Äôre much better off shifting our mindsets to embrace and use the stress wisely!"
Conquer-Procrastination,Tiny Habits,The Small Changes That Change Everything,B. J. Fogg,Philosopher's Notes,"BJ Fogg founded the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University. He is one of the world‚Äôs leading authorities on the science of behavior change. In this book, he introduces us to the core elements of his Fogg Behavior Model as we learn that habit change doesn‚Äôt need to be as hard as we make it. As BJ tells us: ‚ÄúWe are not the problem. Our approach to change is. It‚Äôs a design flaw‚Äînot a personal flaw.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include the three elements that drive behavior (B = MAP!), the ABCs of Tiny Habits (Anchor + (Tiny) Behavior + Celebration!), the power of anchor prompts (After I (ANCHOR), I will (NEW HABIT), and the power of celebration (get your Shine on!)."
Conquer-Procrastination,Atomic Habits,An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,James Clear,Philosopher's Notes,"James Clear has a super-popular website (jamesclear.com). Millions of people visit it every month and hundreds of thousands subscribe to his email newsletter. After reading this book, I can see why. He‚Äôs a great writer and distills the essence of habit formation into, well, its fundamental components‚Äîthe ‚Äúatomic‚Äù structure if you will‚Äîwhile showing us how those TINY little incremental improvements add up to MIGHTY results. I rarely say a book is a must-read but this one‚Äôs as close as it gets. Big Ideas we explore include: The math behind 1% gains compounding over a year (and a decade!), navigating the Plateau of Latent Potential (ever given up on a habit? Take note!), the importance (and etymology) of our Identity (get this: it *literally* means 'repeated being ness'), The 4 Laws of Behavior Change (remember: cue + craving + response + reward and... make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying), and the Sorites Paradox (can a single habit change your life?)."
Conquer-Procrastination,Mini Habits,"Smaller Habits, Bigger Results",Stephen Guise,Philosopher's Notes,"How‚Äôs your habit-building process working for you? If you‚Äôve stalled a few (hundred?) times, Stephen Guise tells us that Mini Habits might be just the thing you‚Äôre looking for! In the Note we look at what a Mini Habit is and how to go about rockin‚Äô it exploring Big Ideas like making habits stupid small (aka ‚Äútoo small to fail‚Äù), embracing Newton‚Äôs 1st law, and being aware of ego depletion as you create your chain!"

Conquer-Digital-Addiction,Conquering Digital Addiction 101,,,101 Classes,"‚Äã‚ÄãTechnology is, obviously, awesome. We‚Äôve been using ‚Äútech‚Äù tools for 2.5 million years since our protohuman ancestors first picked up a stone and used it as a tool. 1.8 million years ago, ‚Äúwe‚Äù figured out how to make an acheulean hand axe which was a pretty epic innovation at the time. ‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚ÄãSo, with the advent of smartphones in what‚Äôs known as the ‚ÄúInput Age,‚Äù I‚Äôm not suggesting we should all become tech-smashing Luddites. But‚Ä¶ (And this is a big but!), I also don‚Äôt think we should underestimate just how much we play the role of addicted users caught up in the mix of a $7 TRILLION attention economics (/mind-hacking!) industry. ‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚ÄãThe solution: Become Optimizites‚Äîuse technology wisely to become the BEST you rather than mindlessly let your 1 million-year-old prefrontal cortex get hacked all day every day. ‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚ÄãIn the class, we walk through the costs of addiction, then talk about how to conquer it so we can sculpt our ideal lives."
Conquer-Digital-Addiction,Digital Minimalism 101,,,101 Classes,"Cal Newport joins us as a guest teacher for this class! He is one of my favorite thinkers. He got his Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT and is now a Professor at Georgetown. He‚Äôs also a bestselling author of a number of books. Given the fact that the fastest way to Optimize your life is to STOP doing things that are sub-optimal AND the fact that (for nearly all of us) our use of technology is the #1 thing that ‚ÄúNeeds work!,‚Äù it‚Äôs SUPER important for us to figure out how to best use all the technology available to us WITHOUT becoming lost in a tsunami of inputs. Enter: Our new philosophy of technology use: Digital Minimalism."
Conquer-Digital-Addiction,Digital Minimalism,Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World,Cal Newport,Philosopher's Notes,"Cal Newport is one of my favorite thinkers. He got his Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT and is now a Professor at Georgetown. He‚Äôs also a bestselling author of a number of books. Given the fact that the fastest way to Optimize your life is to STOP doing things that are sub-optimal AND the fact that (for nearly all of us) our use of technology is the #1 thing that ‚ÄúNeeds work!,‚Äù it‚Äôs SUPER important for us to figure out how to best use all the technology available to us WITHOUT becoming lost in a tsunami of inputs. Enter: Our new philosophy of technology use: Digital Minimalism. Enter: My SUPER strong recommendation of the book and my ALL IN commitment to helping create a movement around the ideas in the book. As you know, I rarely say a book is a must read but this book is as close as it gets. Big Ideas we explore include the fact that your soul is engaged in a lopsided arms race, a definition + overview of digital minimalism, the importance of spending time alone (and the consequences of *not* spending adequate time alone), reclaiming leisure (get active!) and joining the Attention Resistance. Here's to Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World!"
Conquer-Digital-Addiction,Irresistible,The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked,Adam Alter,Philosopher's Notes,"Irresistible. That‚Äôs the perfect word to describe the growing array of addictive technologies that are capturing so much of our attention these days. And, it‚Äôs the perfect name for the book. Adam Alter is an associate professor of marketing at NYU‚Äôs Stern School of Business. This is a great book on, as the sub-title suggests, ‚ÄúThe Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.‚Äù Big Ideas we explore include the fact Steve Jobs didn‚Äôt let his own kids use an iPad (why?), why addiction is about more than just personality (and what matters), how to add 11 years back to your life, what happens when your brain gets pickled and the simple question you can ask to Optimize."
Conquer-Digital-Addiction,Indistractable,How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life,Nir Eyal,Philosopher's Notes,"Nir Eyal is a former lecturer at Stanford‚Äôs Graduate School of Business. His first book was an international bestseller that‚Äôs influenced the product development of pretty much all of the leading tech companies on the planet. It was called Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. We have Nir to thank for helping make the technology we use better. And... As he says, ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs also a dark side. As philosopher Paul Virilio wrote, ‚ÄòWhen you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck.‚Äô In the case of user-friendly products and services, what makes some products engaging and easy to use can also make them distracting.‚Äù After finding HIMSELF hooked to many of the products created by designers inspired by *his* work, Eyal got himself UNHOOKED and, ultimately INDISTRACTABLE. In this great book, he gives us a practical look at *why* we‚Äôre so vulnerable to getting hooked in the first place and, most importantly, how to make ourselves Indistractable so we can control our attention and choose our lives."
Conquer-Digital-Addiction,The Shallows,What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains,Nicholas Carr,Philosopher's Notes,"Wondering what the Internet is doing to our brains? Then I think you‚Äôll love The Shallows. It‚Äôs a fascinating, well-researched, brilliant book.

Conquer-Digital-Addiction,The Distraction Addiction,"Getting the Information You Need and the Communication You Want, Without Enraging Your Family, Annoying Your Colleagues, and Destroying Your Soul",Alex Soojung-Kim Pang,Philosopher's Notes,"Alex Soojung-Kim Pang is a professional futurist. (I think that is officially tied for first for the coolest job title ever. The co-winner? Professional Optimizer, of course. Hah. :) He has a PhD in the history of science and is a former Microsoft Research fellow and visiting scholar at Stanford and Oxford. I found the book fascinating and a great complement to our collection on how to conquer digital addiction. Big Ideas we explore include how to tame that monkey in your mind, email apnea (you breathing?!), the fact that ""entanglement"" tech is over 1 million years old (""Hi, stone tools!""), the big costs of task switching (and an easy way to feel its effects), the importance of experimenting (w/an experiment you can do today), the Latin wisdom solvitur ambulando (""it is solved by walking"") and how to be an Optimizite rather than a Luddite. :)"

Conquer-Digital-Addiction,Brain Wash,"Detox Your Mind for Clearer Thinking, Deeper Relationships, and Lasting Happiness","David Perlmutter, MD, Austin Perlmutter, MD",Philosopher's Notes,"David Perlmutter is one of my favorite nutrition-physicians. We have Notes on a bunch of his books including Grain Brain, Brain Maker, and Power Up Your Brain. So, when I heard about the new book that he wrote with his son Austin (who is also an MD), I was excited to read it. It‚Äôs called Brain Wash. (It‚Äôs kinda like Digital Minimalism written by nutrition-neurologist-physicians. ) As David and Austin say, the book builds on a simple premise: ‚ÄúOur brain‚Äôs performance is being gravely manipulated, resulting in behaviors that leave us more lonely, anxious, depressed, distrustful, illness-prone, and overweight than ever before. At the same time, we feel disconnected from ourselves, from others and from the world at large.‚Äù Their solution? We need to overhaul our mind‚Äôs operating system. How? Via a ‚Äúbrain wash.‚Äù They walk us through the factors that lead to what they call ‚Äúdisconnection syndrome‚Äù and, of course, how to deal with it."
Conquer-Digital-Addiction,Stillness Is the Key,,Ryan Holiday,Philosopher's Notes,"This is our fourth Note on one of Ryan Holiday‚Äôs books. Ryan is one of my absolute favorite writers. One of the testimonials in the front of the book perfectly captures my sentiment. Screenwriter and director Brian Koppelman (Rounders, Ocean‚Äôs Thirteen and Billions) puts it this way: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have many rules in life, but one I never break is: If Ryan Holiday writes a book, I read it as soon as I can get my hands on it.‚Äù (btw: Cal Newport‚Äôs the first testimonial. He says: ‚ÄúSome authors give advice. Ryan Holiday distills wisdom. This book is a must read.‚Äù) Penguin Random House sent me an advance copy of this book. As I knew it would be: It‚Äôs fantastic. Of course, the book‚Äôs packed with Big Ideas and I‚Äôm excited to share some of my favorites so let‚Äôs jump straight in!"

But... In their great book Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin tells us: ‚ÄúSolitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction. Like a great wave that saturates everything in its path, however, handheld devices and other media now leave us awash with the thoughts of others.
