He wrote this book with Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine. This book is, as per the back cover, “a clear-eyed account of learning to lead in a chaotic world” in which Mattis “recounts the foundational experiences and lessons he learned over four decades and in three wars. It is a journey about learning to lead at every level, with insights equally applicable to the military, to business, and to individual growth.” I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a long-time student (and Heroic Coach) who also happens to be a commanding officer in the U.S. military. It’s an absolutely FANTASTIC memoir packed with wisdom on how to lead—which is why it has nearly 5,000 5-star reviews. The book reminds me of two other memoirs by military leaders I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories and General Colin Powell’s It Worked for Me. It also reminds me of Phil Knight’s memoir Shoe Dog and Ray Dalio’s Principles. And... For related books on leadership, check out our Notes on General Stanley McChrystal’s Leaders: Myths and Reality plus Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Leadership in Turbulent Times.

I read it in one 8.8-hour Deep Work-filled day. It’s fantastic. McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history’s most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there’s a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the “myths” of leadership and the MUCH MESSIER “realities” of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership. We end the book with the sober recognition of just how complex, dynamic and context-specific good leadership is. It’s a challenging, important book that’s difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I’m excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership.

Big Ideas we explore include: The Accountability Mirror, bringing your best (when you feel the worst), hero callouses (let failures toughen you up!), the process (how to go from running 1/4 of a mile to 200+ nonstop), and bursting from the inside out (learn to endure!).","title":"Can’t Hurt Me","pnSubtitle":"Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds","slug":"cant-hurt-me-david-goggins","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","authorDetails":[{"__typename":"Author","id":"3036","slug":"david-goggins","authorName":"David Goggins","imageUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/david-goggins.jpg","tagline":"Retired Navy SEAL \u0026 Endurance Athlete.","contentType":"AUTHOR"}],"coverImage":"https://assets.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/book-covers/cant-hurt-me-cover.png","contentType":"PHILOSOPHERNOTE","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PhilosopherNote","id":"31914","intro":"I got this book immediately after finishing Admiral McRaven’s first book, Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...

I had a strong feeling this memoir on his “Life in Special Operations” would be just as good. It is. As per the back cover, “Admiral William H. McRaven is a part of American military history, having been involved in some of the most famous missions in recent memory, including the capture of Saddam Hussein, the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, and the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.” McRaven is a brilliant story teller with, as you can imagine, an incredible array of stories to tell.

He also has twenty-five years of experience as an entrepreneur. In this book, he draws on his decades of leadership experience to teach us the “7 Leadership Commitments That Forge Elite Teams.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI knew Mark was voted the honor man of his SEAL class and that he is an extraordinarily powerful human being (which is why I’ve suggested more than once that he needs his own action figure).

(Pause, reflect on that courageous awesomeness for a moment.) He started BUD/S class 170 with 185 other “absolute studs.” Only 19 (!) of the 185 who started made it to graduation day.

(Wow.) (Pause, reflect on that leadership awesomeness for a moment.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe book is packed with great stories and wisdom from Mark’s authentic sharing of his “tortuous” path from early leadership success to many failures en route to a deeper sense of clarity on what it takes to “stare down the wolf” of fear and forge elite teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the next several days, we’ll talk about how to stare down that wolf of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll start at the top. Mark tells us: “\u003cem\u003eYou may know that the analogy of the fear wolf comes from a Native American tale of a negative wolf that resides in the minds of humans. This wolf operates from fear, is hungry for drama, catastrophizes, and has incessant negative self-talk.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut there is also a second, positive wolf residing in the heart. This one has an appetite for love and connection, is not addicted to drama, and is optimistic and focused on others.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe fear wolf fights for your attention and demands dominance. The courage wolf asks simply to be noticed, seeking some esteem-building food. According to the legend, the one that ultimately controls you is the one you feed the most.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you constantly feed fear by thinking about the could-haves, the should-haves, the would-haves, and the can’ts in life—if you allow negative beliefs, attitudes, and conditioned behavior from whatever drama you experienced or stories you adopted—then the fear wolf gets stronger. Eventually he gets so strong that the courage wolf is left cowering, unable to fight back.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHowever, you can stare that fear wolf down and refuse to feed it any longer. Starve it of that negative conditioning! Then you can feed the courage wolf a steady diet of good food, and lead with your heart and mind as equal partners.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s notice the two wolves within.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, as Mark said in his hand-written note in my copy of the book:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Stare down the wolf!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(TODAY.)\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"staring-down-the-wolf","title":"Staring Down the Wolf","subtitle":"Which One Are YOU Feeding?","videoThumbnail":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/videos/thumbnails/original/Optimize-01103-staring-down-the-wolf-thumb.jpg","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PlusOne","id":"35310","authorizationState":"ANONYMOUS","contentType":"PLUSONE","audioUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/downloads/mp3s/files/Optimize-0662-the-goggins-process.mp3","number":662,"intro":"In our last +1, we talked about real-life superhero David Goggins and the Cookie Jar that’s helped him become one of the best (and most","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/navy-seal-cookie-jars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eIn our last +1\u003c/a\u003e, we talked about real-life superhero \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/david-goggins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDavid Goggins\u003c/a\u003e and the Cookie Jar that’s helped him become one of the best (and most inspiring) endurance athletes (and humans) in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid you craft your (sugar- and flour-free) metaphorical Cookies as we continue the hard work of making our prior best our new baseline?

Like many things in life, success in BUD/S didn’t always go to the strongest, the fastest, or the smartest.

It’s still trying to figure out exactly what happens in your body when you sip a soda, or what is going on deep in the soul of a carrot to make it so good for you, or why in the world you have so many neurons—brain cells!—in your stomach, of all places. It’s a fascinating subject, and someday the field may produce definitive answers to the nutritional questions that concern us, but—as nutritionists themselves will tell you—they’re not there yet. Not even close. Nutrition science, which after all only got started less than two hundred years ago, is today approximately where surgery was in the year 1650—very promising, and very interesting to watch, but are you ready to let them operate on you?

This is what I meant when I said the picture got simpler the deeper I went.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere are basically two important things you need to know about the links between diet and health, two facts that are not in dispute. All the contending parties in the nutrition wars agree on them.

Populations that eat a typical Western diet consisting of “\u003cem\u003elots of processed foods and meat, lots of added fat and sugar, lots of refined grains, lots of everything except vegetables, fruits and whole grains\u003c/em\u003e” suffer from the typical Western diseases of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFact #2. Populations that don’t eat that stuff don’t suffer from those chronic diseases. Their traditional diets vary TREMENDOUSLY—from the super high fat diets of the Inuit in Greenland who eat mostly seal blubber to the super high carbohydrate diets of Central American Indians who eat a ton of maize and beans to the super high protein diets of the Masai in Africa who eat mostly cattle meat, blood and milk. But, even with that extreme variety, they DO NOT suffer from the chronic diseases we suffer from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePollan tells us there “is no single ideal human diet” and that the human omnivore has evolved to handle a variety of different diets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEXCEPT ONE: The Western diet that most of us now eat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost nutritionists argue about which particular component within the Western diet is the ultimate culprit. For our purposes, we simply need to step back and remove the primary staples of the Western diet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Pollan says, “\u003cem\u003ePeople who get off the Western diet see dramatic improvements in their health.

For most celebrity actors, only as good as their last movie, the self is under constant evaluation, repeated threat. The same is true for international scientists, only as good as their last paper, their past achievements having set the bar at heights they have to exceed again and again. Or the salesperson, only as good as the last contract landed. After all, people do not compare the director’s new movie, the scientist’s new scientific paper or the businessman’s latest deal with his average achievement. They compare it with the most easily remembered previous movie/paper/deal—which is usually the best one.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd that is the proposed solution to the mystery of the Oscars—winning an Oscar may offer a powerful and near-everlasting ‘safety signal for self’—a sort of lifelong insurance policy that protects ‘me’ against the terrible stress of other people’s negative evaluations. Winning an Oscar may be one lifelong ‘all clear’ air-raid siren—a permanent safety signal that your self is secure. That is perhaps why winning an Oscar makes you live so much longer—by protecting your self, it defends your body.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s from a fascinating chapter called “The Mystery of the Oscars” in which we explore the question: “Why do we want to win?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Note: Each of the core chapters in the book answers a different question—starting with “Are we born to win?” then moving on to “Is winning a matter of chance and circumstances?” then “What does power do to us?” and concluding with “Does winning have a downside?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShort answers are: No. No. A lot.

We must create a system that constantly reminds us who … we are when we are at our best, because life is not going to pick us up when we fall. There will be forks in the road … mountains to climb, and we are only capable of living up to the image we create for ourselves.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: He ALSO tells us that we need to discipline ourselves to BRING OUR BEST when we FEEL THE WORST.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us: \u003cem\u003e“Remember, visualization will never compensate for the work undone. You cannot visualize lies. All the strategies I employ to answer the simple questions and win the mind game are effective because I put in work. It’s a lot more than mind over matter. It takes relentless self-discipline to schedule suffering into your day, every day, but if you do, you’ll find that at the other end of that suffering is a whole other life just waiting for you.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s a good one-two punch for antifragile confidence. Start by showing up and EARNING your own trust by doing what needs to get done whether you feel like it or not. Then, make sure you’ve got your cookie jar of you at your best filled up so you can get fueled by those past successes when you really need it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhil Stutz says basically the exact same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us that we need to have a “highlight reel” of past successes ready at hand that we can put on repeat when we’re feeling self-doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, as we’ve discussed countless times, he tells us that we need to cultivate our emotional stamina. Remember: “The worse I feel, the more committed I am to the protocol.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe and I actually chatted about this Idea in our Coaching session the other day. I read him part of the blurb and asked him what he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe told me he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen said that the \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e challenge is: “How do you have the Oscar without having the Oscar?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe true winner, he says, is not dependent on any outer event or object to feel like a winner. The metrics we measure ourselves against must be within our control.

Now it’s time for Hell Week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most brutal aspects of the training is when the aspiring SEALs are split into “boat crews”—each with seven guys. Each team gets an old-school World War II-era inflatable boat that weighs 200 pounds. They need to carry this boat up and over 20-foot-high sand berms and run with it for miles. Then they get to paddle it out to the ocean, dump it over so everyone’s out and freezing wet and then paddle it back in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’re always competing with everyone else.

Train this ability via meditation and practice with the little day-to-day things that trigger us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we notice the negativity, we need to STOP the negative thoughts. Aggressively. We \u003cstrong\u003eInterdict\u003c/strong\u003e them with power statements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo \u003cem\u003einterdict\u003c/em\u003e means to “prohibit or forbid.” It also means “to intercept and prevent the movement of (a prohibited commodity or person).” From a military perspective, it means to “impede (an enemy force), especially by aerial bombing of lines of communication or supply.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssentially, we want to bomb the enemy force of negativity. To, in Mark’s words: \u003cem\u003e“blow up negative mental chatter and allow your mind to still itself and await its next set of instructions.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe do that by dropping power statements on the negative thoughts. Stuff like, \u003cem\u003e“I’ve got this!!!” “Piece of cake.” “Let’s do this!”\u003c/em\u003e or whatever else resonates with you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStep 3.

In fact, I’m going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism—along with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic. If you’re looking for “A Philosopher’s Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient,” I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did. I HIGHLY recommend it.","title":"The Stoic Challenge","pnSubtitle":"A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient","slug":"the-stoic-challenge-william-irvine","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","authorDetails":[{"__typename":"Author","id":"2572","slug":"william-b-irvine","authorName":"William B.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jocko Willink is a retired Navy SEAL. He was commander of Task Unit Bruiser―the most decorated Special Operations Unit of the Iraq War. I really enjoyed Jocko’s first book Extreme Ownership and I knew this one would be good but... I didn’t expect it to be THIS good. The words literally explode off the page. Not just because each micro-chapter was an incredibly inspiring micro-manifesto but because each word was written by a man so clearly living in complete integrity with his deepest values. John Maxwell would say his “moral authority” is extraordinary. I’d say his SOUL FORCE is palpable. If you’re in the mood for a soul-rattling call-to-disciplined action, I think you’ll enjoy the book as much as I did.</div>

We started with Make Your Bed—a short, brilliant, inspiring manual all about “Little Things That Can Change Your Life... And Maybe the World” that was inspired by McRaven’s commencement address at the University of Texas at Austin that went viral. Then we featured his autobiography called Sea Stories which is all about the wisdom he gained from his nearly four decades in special operations. This is his latest book. Of course, when I saw the title I KNEW I had to read it. And, here we are.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">James Stockdale spent 7 1/2 years as the highest ranking prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. 4 years in solitary confinement. 2 in leg irons. This book is about how he endured all of that with the wisdom of Stoic philosopher Epictetus in mind. In the Note, we explore the key tenets of Stoicism, the Stockdale Paradox, playing your role well and mastering your emotions.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Vice Admiral James Stockdale is an American hero. Stockdale spent nearly eight years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He spent four of those years in solitary confinement and was repeatedly tortured. He was the commanding officer of hundreds of other U.S. soldiers and received the Medal of Honor for his service beyond the call of duty. This is an incredibly inspiring look at the powerful mind and equally powerful moral commitment of a hero. Big Ideas we explore: Being our brother’s keeper, chiseling our integrity to achieve delight with life, courage as endurance of the soul and heroes vs. bums.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fourth Note on one of Admiral McRaven’s great books. As we discussed in the previous Notes, as a four-star admiral, McRaven’s final assignment was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces. He served as a Navy SEAL for 37 years. By the time he hit 34 years of service, he was officially anointed as the “Bull Frog”—the longest serving frogman and Navy SEAL on active duty. This book, as per the title, is wisdom from this legendary bullfrog. McRaven distills leadership into its most fundamental components, delivering on the subtitle: “Leadership Made Simple (But Not Easy).” As you’d expect, it’s PACKED with practical wisdom.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">General Jim Mattis is the former Secretary of Defense and one of the most formidable strategic thinkers of the twenty-first century. He wrote this book with Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine. This book is, as per the back cover, “a clear-eyed account of learning to lead in a chaotic world” in which Mattis “recounts the foundational experiences and lessons he learned over four decades and in three wars. It is a journey about learning to lead at every level, with insights equally applicable to the military, to business, and to individual growth.” I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a long-time student (and Heroic Coach) who also happens to be a commanding officer in the U.S. military. It’s an absolutely FANTASTIC memoir packed with wisdom on how to lead—which is why it has nearly 5,000 5-star reviews. The book reminds me of two other memoirs by military leaders I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories and General Colin Powell’s It Worked for Me. It also reminds me of Phil Knight’s memoir Shoe Dog and Ray Dalio’s Principles. And... For related books on leadership, check out our Notes on General Stanley McChrystal’s Leaders: Myths and Reality plus Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Leadership in Turbulent Times.

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book (along with a dozen others!) after reading Admiral Manazir’s great book Learn How to Lead to Win. It’s a FANTASTIC, quick-reading, laugh-out-loud funny addition to our growing pantheon of Navy SEAL books. David Goggins wrote the foreword to the book. He and Brent were in the same SEAL class (235) and they both share a fondness for hard-hitting, no-nonsense wisdom delivered with an ample share of f-bombs. As you’d expect, the book is packed with Big Ideas. And, as always, I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Mike Manazir (“Muh-naw-zur”) is a Retired US Navy Admiral and Top Gun Fighter Pilot. I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a Commanding Officer in the US military (and a Heroic Coach). My friend recommended Jim Mattis’s book on leadership (Call Sign Chaos) and that book was so good that I asked him what *other* books on leadership he’d recommend. He immediately told me about this one. I immediately got it. Manazir was one of his cherished mentors. After reading this great book, I can see why. The book is, as you’d expect from the title, all about helping us learn how to lead to win. It’s part memoir, part leadership manual—featuring 33 powerful stories from Admiral Manazir’s life and the lessons he gained along the way. It reminds me of another memoir by another Navy Admiral I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories. In fact, as I type that, I realize that this book is kinda like a hybrid of McRaven’s memoir AND his latest book called The Hero Code. Mash those two books up and swap out the SEAL stories for a Top Gun Fighter Pilot’s and voilà—you get this book. As you’d expect, the book is PACKED with Big Ideas. I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book after I saw General Stanley McChrystal’s blurb on the back of Ryan Holiday’s Lives of the Stoics. I read it in one 8.8-hour Deep Work-filled day. It’s fantastic. McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history’s most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there’s a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the “myths” of leadership and the MUCH MESSIER “realities” of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership. We end the book with the sober recognition of just how complex, dynamic and context-specific good leadership is. It’s a challenging, important book that’s difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I’m excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership. So... Let’s get to work!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book after my friend, retired Navy SEAL Captain Bob Schoultz, recommended it to me. It’s ASTONISHINGLY good. As per the sub-title, this book is about "The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown." It's a humbling, inspiring story "of an American hero who bravely gave permission in his final written requests to share his journey, from small-town America to gutter to jail to Jesus to war to the top tier of the U.S. military: SEAL Team Six.”</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Alden Mills is a three-time Navy SEAL platoon commander and the Founder/CEO of Perfect Fitness (which was one of Inc.’s fastest-growing companies in the country). He’s also the father of four boys, a great writer/storyteller and, most importantly, an inspiring human being. I loved Alden’s first book Be Unstoppable. This book (and the AMAZING Unstoppable Teams 101 class Alden created with us for our Optimizers!!) is packed with wisdom gleaned from Alden’s 25+ years of experience working with high-performing teams. It’s fantastic.

<div class="line-clamp-2">David Goggins is a former Navy SEAL (and Army Ranger) who used to hold a Guinness World Record for completing 4,030 pull-ups in 17 hours. These days he’s setting records as an ultra-endurance athlete. But he wasn’t always Mr. Superhero. In this great autobiographical self-help book, David walks us through his transformation from being a 297-pound exterminator to a “Who IS this guy?!” superhero. If you’re into SUPER (!!!) intense demonstrations of how to conquer ourselves to do the seemingly impossible (and don’t mind a stream of f-bombs—lol) then I think you’ll love this book as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include: The Accountability Mirror, bringing your best (when you feel the worst), hero callouses (let failures toughen you up!), the process (how to go from running 1/4 of a mile to 200+ nonstop), and bursting from the inside out (learn to endure!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book immediately after finishing Admiral McRaven’s first book, Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life... And Maybe the World. That one’s a quick-reading little book on the ten lessons McRaven learned in his SEAL training that we can all apply to our modern lives. It was fantastic. I had a strong feeling this memoir on his “Life in Special Operations” would be just as good. It is. As per the back cover, “Admiral William H. McRaven is a part of American military history, having been involved in some of the most famous missions in recent memory, including the capture of Saddam Hussein, the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, and the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.” McRaven is a brilliant story teller with, as you can imagine, an incredible array of stories to tell. But that’s not why I loved this book so much. I loved it because reading it made me want to be a better human being. If you enjoy autobiographies and appreciate the military heroes who serve our country as much as I do, I think you’ll love the book as much as I did.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Admiral William H. McRaven is a Retired U.S. Navy SEAL who served for thirty-seven years and commanded at every level. As a Four-Star Admiral, his final assignment was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces. (During this time, he oversaw the covert mission that killed Osama bin Laden.) In 2014, he gave the commencement address to the graduates of the University of Texas at Austin. Millions of people wound up watching his speech on ten lessons he learned from his Navy SEAL training. This book takes a deeper look at those ten lessons. It’s a super-quick read—packed with simple, yet profound wisdom along with moving stories of moral exemplars. It's FANTASTIC.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is a surprisingly awesome book—a fable about a young captain who spends time with a master and commander who reveals the secret code of rockin’ it. It’s kinda like if a Navy SEAL wrote The Alchemist or The Way of the Peaceful Warrior or The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. Big Ideas we cover include: U.P.E.R.S.I.S.T. (the code to being unstoppable), the 2 limitations in life, how to discover your why, how to plan in 3-D, and the magic pill you need to take.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Solitude. It’s the secret sauce to leadership. But... In their great book Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin tells us: “Solitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction. Like a great wave that saturates everything in its path, however, handheld devices and other media now leave us awash with the thoughts of others. We are losing solitude without even realizing it.” Big Ideas we explore include the big 4 of solitude (clarity + creativity + emotional balance + moral courage), the threats from our "Input Age," how MLK and Eisenhower used solitude, FOMO (get over it!) and how to change the world (starting with YOU!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Alexandra got this book for me after she saw that Ben Greenfield recommended it. Douglass Brackmann got a dual PhD in 2002. Then he “struck out to research the components of powerful thought and action, helping driven ‘hunters’ focus their gifts.” We explore the paradoxical truth of Optimizing and actualizing as a Driven person (hint: discipline equals freedom), the fact that you have a great story to write (and you need structures to channel your energy), the Mastery Mindset (how’s yours?), the reality that better has no finish line (that’s worth repeating: better has no finish line), you and your sword (forging time!), and the Mastery Path (you on it?).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Colin Powell is a retired four-star general in the United States Army and has earned numerous military, civilian, and foreign honors. He served four presidential administrations in a variety of roles, most recently as Secretary of State from 2001 to 2005. In this great book, he shares the wisdom he gained that, as per the title, worked for him in life and leadership. It's fantastic. Big Ideas we explore include a super-quick look at his Thirteen Rules, the power of perpetual optimism (it's a force multiplier!), starting with "It can be done" (but making sure we're optimists and not stupid :), entering the Zone of Calm (essential for a leader), the fact that good leaders know that good plans are revised immediately, and how to deal with fear and failure.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Doris Kearns Goodwin has been studying presidential history and leadership for five decades since she first became a professor at Harvard. She has won a Pulitzer Prize and her bestseller Team of Rivals was the basis for Steven Spielberg’s Academy Award–winning film Lincoln. In this book, she walks us through four case studies in leadership: Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson. If you enjoy studying leadership like I do, I think you’ll love this book as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include the one quality all of our very different leaders possessed (hint: FIERCE AMBITION), Lincoln's commitment to growth ("I must die or be better"), the importance of a growth mindset, acquiring virtue Teddy Roosevelt style and the importance of finding ways to relieve stress.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our 4th Note on one of John Maxwell’s books. We also have Notes on The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth, and How Successful People Think. John is one of my absolute favorite writers and teachers. His books are *ridiculously* packed with Big Ideas. (Like, jumbo-ridiculously packed with practical wisdom.) As we’ve discussed, he’s one of the world’s leading authorities on leadership. He’s sold over 25 million copies of his dozens of books that have been translated into over 50 languages. His organizations have also trained leaders in EVERY single country around the world. This is his most recent book, written after FIFTY (!) years of leadership. As per the sub-title, John walks us through the “11 Essential Changes” he has made and that he encourages every leader to embrace. Big Ideas we explore include a quick look at the 11 essential leadershifts, layered learning (compound those +1s!), consistency (how to pay the price of leadership), moral authority (the highest form of leadership!), and the Clock + the Compass (how to fulfill your destiny TODAY).</div>

They’re both Professors at Stanford and have been married for 30+ years. This is a thoughtful and thought-provoking book that challenges the “new science of morality”’s view that morality is essentially biologically and socially determined. Damon and Colby argue that we all have the power to cultivate our more noble, moral possibilities.

<div class="line-clamp-2">William B. Irvine is a professor of philosophy at Wright State University. He’s also a fantastic (and prolific) writer. And… Unlike many of his academic, professor-of-philosophy peers, he is a practicing Stoic philosopher. In the words of Donald Robertson (another Stoic author and practitioner; see The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), he is both a librarian AND a warrior of the mind. We featured another one of Professor Irvine’s great books on Stoicism called A Guide to the Good Life. I enjoyed that one quite a bit but I REALLY (!) enjoyed this one. Like, jumbo loved it. In fact, I’m going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism—along with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic. If you’re looking for “A Philosopher’s Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient,” I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did. I HIGHLY recommend it.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Ian Robertson is a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist. He’s widely considered one of the world’s leading researchers in neuropsychology. This book is, essentially, a fascinating tour through his decades-long pursuit to scientifically test Nietzsche’s maxim “What doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger.” Big Ideas we explore include the double-edge sword of stress (remember the Yerkes-Dodson Law and how to Optimize it!), the power of saying "I feel excited!" (rather than "I feel anxious."), the fact that a wandering mind is an UNHAPPY mind (crazy studio show it), Hall of Fame researching stats (note: failing nearly 70% of the time), and the power of BELIEVING we can use stress to get stronger (it ALL starts with belief).</div>

McGonigal tells us that how we THINK about stress plays a huge role in its affect on us and walks us thru the science behind it. Rather than try to get rid of stress (good luck with that!), we’re much better off shifting our mindsets to embrace and use the stress wisely!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jim Afremow is one of the world’s leading sports psychologists. We covered his first book The Champion’s Mind. This one is kinda like part 2 in which we look at how the Champion responds to the inevitable (!) setbacks faced on the road to greatness—using those setbacks as opportunities to bounce back and make a sweet comeback. Big Ideas we explore include seeing setbacks as challenges rather than threats, outperforming our contracts, practicing ’till you can’t get it wrong, and the 3 P’s of peak performance.</div>

In this book, we learn how to love storms—how to use simple tools to find strength in the inevitable storms of life as we “transform stress, live in balance and find peace of mind.” Big Ideas we explore: “I love storms.” -Gandhi, Eudaimantra (how I came up w/the perfect mantra for myself), how to end all boredom, time as an infinite cosmic carpet, the secret of life (in one sentence) and Gandhi 101: how to become fearless.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Stephen Joseph is one of the world’s leading researchers on the science of posttraumatic growth. He is also a professor and therapist. He started his career studying posttraumatic stress. In the process, he saw that many people experienced significant growth as a result of the stress they endured--at which point, he started developing his ideas on posttraumatic growth. Fast-forward a few decades and here we are. the title is a play on Nietzsche’s famous dictum: “What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.” While the sub-title perfectly captures the focus of the book: “The New Psychology of Posttraumatic Growth.” Big Ideas we explore include: Eudaimonic Treadmills (note: there aren't any!), posttraumatic growth (and how to use stress as the engine for growth), the shattered vase (taking the pieces and making an antifragile mosaic), harvesting hope (the 1 + 2 + 3s for trauma survivors).</div>

And, in this great, old-school book (written in 1993), he shows us how to go about doing that. Big Ideas we explore in the Note include how toughening happens (key: adaptive stress!!), the importance of training recovery, ultradian rhythms and emotional phones ringing.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">If you’ve ever worked out at a CrossFit gym and/or watched the Reebok CrossFit Games, you know that the absolute best CrossFit athletes are absolute beasts. Well, Ben Bergeron has been the coach behind six world championships. This book is his inspirational, wisdom-packed (!!!) look at how he coaches greatness told through the lens of the 2016 Games in which his athletes (Mat Fraser and Katrín Davíðsdóttir) BOTH won. (Think about that... He coached BOTH the men’s and the women’s champions. &lt;- That’s amazing.) My copy of the book is r i d i c u l o u s l y marked up. The book is OUTSTANDING. Big Ideas we explore include: Committing to excellence (vs. "Meh, I'm good enough."), the 12 character traits of a champion, grit (how's yours?), positivity (selection attention + confirmation bias), embracing adversity (overload and get stronger!), and acting like a champion NOW.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Dr. Bob Rotella is widely recognized as the world’s leading sports psychologist. He’s coached everyone from basketball stars like LeBron James to rock stars like Seal. The golfers he’s coached (including greats like Rory McIlroy) have won an astonishing 80+ major championships. Want to know how champions think in both sports AND life? Well, here you go. Big Ideas we explore include the importance of going for "exceptionalism" (by definition, to be great/a champion you need to be an "exception" to the norm so...), a message from God (key takeaway: focus on the process, results are all good), train it and trust it, enthusiasm (it's the catalyst of champions), how to create your own reality (hint: don't do what average people do), and how to win the ultimate game of life.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Daniel Goleman is a former New York Times science writer and author of the uber-bestselling book Emotional Intelligence. In Focus, we look at the underlying neuroscience of attention. We need to start by realizing that the strength (or weakness) of our attention is at the core of E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G. we do. Everything! Which is why Goleman calls it “the hidden driver of excellence.” Big Ideas we explore include rumination vs. reflection, the three foci of willpower, smart practice and hitting the mental gym.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Stan Beecham is a sports psychologist who has worked with many of the world’s elite athletes. As per the title of the book, he tells us that it’s their MINDS that make the difference in sustained high levels of performance—creating a competitive edge and maximizing success. Big Ideas we explore include your case of mistaken identity (you're greater than you think), the curse of perfection (remember to play poorly well), the true meaning of the word "compete" (= "to strive WITH" not against) and of the word "contest" (= "to make a promise"!) your ultimate opponent (fear!!) and the ultimate question: To go or not to go (Answer: GO!!!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Anders Ericsson is the world’s leading scientist studying expert performance—looking at how, precisely, the people who are the best in the world at what they do became the best. In this Note, we take a quick look at The Gift that we all have that’s the key to our potential greatness, HOW to go about tapping into the benefits of that gift via a certain type of practice (forget naive practice and go for purposeful + deliberate!), the fact that there is no such thing as a “10,000 Hour Rule,” and why we should be called Homo Exercens rather than Homo Sapiens. :)</div>

Jim Mattis is the former Secretary of Defense and one of the most formidable strategic thinkers of the twenty-first century. He wrote this book with Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine. This book is, as per the back cover, “a clear-eyed account of learning to lead in a chaotic world” in which Mattis “recounts the foundational experiences and lessons he learned over four decades and in three wars. It is a journey about learning to lead at every level, with insights equally applicable to the military, to business, and to individual growth.” I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a long-time student (and Heroic Coach) who also happens to be a commanding officer in the U.S. military. It’s an absolutely FANTASTIC memoir packed with wisdom on how to lead—which is why it has nearly 5,000 5-star reviews. The book reminds me of two other memoirs by military leaders I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories and General Colin Powell’s It Worked for Me. It also reminds me of Phil Knight’s memoir Shoe Dog and Ray Dalio’s Principles. And... For related books on leadership, check out our Notes on General Stanley McChrystal’s Leaders: Myths and Reality plus Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Leadership in Turbulent Times.

I read it in one 8.8-hour Deep Work-filled day. It’s fantastic. McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history’s most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there’s a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the “myths” of leadership and the MUCH MESSIER “realities” of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership. We end the book with the sober recognition of just how complex, dynamic and context-specific good leadership is. It’s a challenging, important book that’s difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I’m excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership.

McRaven is a part of American military history, having been involved in some of the most famous missions in recent memory, including the capture of Saddam Hussein, the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, and the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.” McRaven is a brilliant story teller with, as you can imagine, an incredible array of stories to tell. But that’s not why I loved this book so much. I loved it because reading it made me want to be a better human being.

If a helo crashed, but we still had sufficient force to move to the target, we would continue the mission, but alert the Quick Reaction Force and medevac. Everything was binary. On missions like these you don’t want emotions driving your decisions. If we were compromised crossing the border and the Pakistanis threatened to shoot down our helos, you could easily convince yourself that the mission was so important that you must press forward.

This wolf operates from fear, is hungry for drama, catastrophizes, and has incessant negative self-talk.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut there is also a second, positive wolf residing in the heart. This one has an appetite for love and connection, is not addicted to drama, and is optimistic and focused on others.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe fear wolf fights for your attention and demands dominance. The courage wolf asks simply to be noticed, seeking some esteem-building food. According to the legend, the one that ultimately controls you is the one you feed the most.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you constantly feed fear by thinking about the could-haves, the should-haves, the would-haves, and the can’ts in life—if you allow negative beliefs, attitudes, and conditioned behavior from whatever drama you experienced or stories you adopted—then the fear wolf gets stronger. Eventually he gets so strong that the courage wolf is left cowering, unable to fight back.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHowever, you can stare that fear wolf down and refuse to feed it any longer. Starve it of that negative conditioning! Then you can feed the courage wolf a steady diet of good food, and lead with your heart and mind as equal partners.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s notice the two wolves within.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, as Mark said in his hand-written note in my copy of the book:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Stare down the wolf!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(TODAY.)\u003c/p\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"41:Tbe2,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/navy-seal-cookie-jars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eIn our last +1\u003c/a\u003e, we talked about real-life superhero \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/david-goggins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDavid Goggins\u003c/a\u003e and the Cookie Jar that’s helped him become one of the best (and most inspiring) endurance athletes (and humans) in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid you craft your (sugar- and flour-free) metaphorical Cookies as we continue the hard work of making our prior best our new baseline?

When you tackled just one problem, one event, or, in the vernacular of BUD/S training, one evolution at a time, then the difficult became manageable. Like many things in life, success in BUD/S didn’t always go to the strongest, the fastest, or the smartest.

It’s still trying to figure out exactly what happens in your body when you sip a soda, or what is going on deep in the soul of a carrot to make it so good for you, or why in the world you have so many neurons—brain cells!—in your stomach, of all places. It’s a fascinating subject, and someday the field may produce definitive answers to the nutritional questions that concern us, but—as nutritionists themselves will tell you—they’re not there yet. Not even close. Nutrition science, which after all only got started less than two hundred years ago, is today approximately where surgery was in the year 1650—very promising, and very interesting to watch, but are you ready to let them operate on you? I think I’ll wait awhile.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHAH!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLove that.

Populations that eat a typical Western diet consisting of “\u003cem\u003elots of processed foods and meat, lots of added fat and sugar, lots of refined grains, lots of everything except vegetables, fruits and whole grains\u003c/em\u003e” suffer from the typical Western diseases of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFact #2. Populations that don’t eat that stuff don’t suffer from those chronic diseases. Their traditional diets vary TREMENDOUSLY—from the super high fat diets of the Inuit in Greenland who eat mostly seal blubber to the super high carbohydrate diets of Central American Indians who eat a ton of maize and beans to the super high protein diets of the Masai in Africa who eat mostly cattle meat, blood and milk. But, even with that extreme variety, they DO NOT suffer from the chronic diseases we suffer from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePollan tells us there “is no single ideal human diet” and that the human omnivore has evolved to handle a variety of different diets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEXCEPT ONE: The Western diet that most of us now eat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost nutritionists argue about which particular component within the Western diet is the ultimate culprit.

Train this ability via meditation and practice with the little day-to-day things that trigger us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we notice the negativity, we need to STOP the negative thoughts.

His books are *ridiculously* packed with Big Ideas. (Like, jumbo-ridiculously packed with practical wisdom.) As we’ve discussed, he’s one of the world’s leading authorities on leadership. He’s sold over 25 million copies of his dozens of books that have been translated into over 50 languages. His organizations have also trained leaders in EVERY single country around the world. This is his most recent book, written after FIFTY (!) years of leadership. As per the sub-title, John walks us through the “11 Essential Changes” he has made and that he encourages every leader to embrace. Big Ideas we explore include a quick look at the 11 essential leadershifts, layered learning (compound those +1s!), consistency (how to pay the price of leadership), moral authority (the highest form of leadership!), and the Clock + the Compass (how to fulfill your destiny TODAY).6b:T45e,William B.
