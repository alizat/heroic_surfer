I loved it as another way to drill Maffetone’s core ideas into my mind and training methodology. It’s basically a holistic look at all the marginal gains we can apply to reach our running potential. Big Ideas we cover include a quick look at just how fast a 1:59 pace is (sub-4:35 min mile for 26.2 miles = CRAZY fast!), the importance of the MIND in hitting the target, why AEROBIC speed is so important (plus, what it is and how to train it), the ideal training schedule (is super dynamic and personal), how to run properly (hot coal technique!), and balancing the catabolic + anabolic phases of training.","title":"1:59","pnSubtitle":"The Sub-Two-Hour Marathon Is Within Reach―Here's How It Will Go Down, and What It Can Teach All Runners about Training and Racing","slug":"159-philip-maffetone","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","authorDetails":[{"__typename":"Author","id":"2980","slug":"dr-philip-maffetone","authorName":"Dr. Philip Maffetone","imageUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/dr-philip-maffetone.jpg","tagline":"Author, researcher, clinician.

He’s a fascinating, iconoclastic guy who’s been preaching the power of burning fat for fuel for FOUR decades—demonstrating that it’s not only an optimal approach to endurance fitness but to our optimal health as well. In this book, Phil focuses his big brain on what he calls the “overfat” pandemic. He uses the word “overfat” to describe people who have “excess body fat sufficient to impair health.” Overweight and obese people fall into this category. AND... Even people at a “healthy” weight can be overfat. In fact, according to his research, 90% (!!!) of Americans fall into the “overfat” category. (Yikes!)

Yet exercise is a lot less expensive, usually with no side effects apart from soreness.

Quick recap: As per the Alexander Technique training I did on a tiny little island in Greece back in the day, imagine having a thread that runs from the top of your head down through your spine. Gently pull it up—lengthening (and widening) your spine. When you sit. When you stand. When you walk. All day every day. Experts in that method say that’s one of the keys to grace and poise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have \u003cstrong\u003ePower Poses\u003c/strong\u003e: I also like to think of \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/amy-cuddy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAmy Cuddy\u003c/a\u003e’s research on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/big-ideas/whats-ideal-posture-look-like/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003epower of our posture\u003c/a\u003e. As it turns out, Amy was actually a ballet dancer as well. Recall her research on how to cultivate \u003cem\u003ePresence\u003c/em\u003e. One of her big things, of course, is to strike a power pose. Channel your inner Superman or Wonder Woman. When you sit. When you stand. When you walk. All day every day. Experts in this field of research say this is one of the most effective ways to cultivate our presence and power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally we have \u003cstrong\u003eThor’s Hammer\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/eric-goodman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eEric Goodman\u003c/a\u003e is one of the world’s leading biomechanic experts.

Well, technically I want to talk about the science behind how we get stronger and connect that to a little etymology lesson and then connect that to some overlooked natural anabolic “steroids” in our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, here we go…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this stage, we’ve all heard of “anabolic steroids.” They make people super strong. (And a little freaky.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, do you know the difference between the “anabolic” phase of training and the “catabolic” phase? Although becoming a certified trainer was one of the first things I did when I started my Optimizing adventures nearly 20 years ago, I couldn’t have told you with precision what those terms meant until I read Maffetone’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-endurance-handbook-philip-maffetone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEndurance Handbook\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the short story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you work out, you exit your comfort zone and “overload” your body. (Maffetone calls this “overreaching.”) That’s the CATABOLIC phase of training. You’re breaking yourself down. This is, of course, essential for your growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, after you work out, your body starts repairing the damage you did and, in the process, “overcompensates” and makes you stronger. That’s the ANABOLIC phase of training. You’re building yourself back up. This is, of course, essential for your growth. (In fact, this is actually where the growth occurs.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe need BOTH to be Optimized. Too much or too little of either and we’re going to run into issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich is why Maffetone incessantly repeats his formula: \u003cstrong\u003eTraining = Workout + Recovery\u003c/strong\u003e. (He also tells us that we should write that down and look at it every day which is why it’s front and center on my chalkboard these days.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe puts it this way: \u003cem\u003e“The anabolic aspect of the training schedule involves recovery; and this means getting sufficient rest. Unlike the catabolic gas pedal, the natural anabolic action is likened to the brakes that cause one to stop and take it easy. It allows the physical, chemical, and mental aspects of the body to revive themselves and fully heal. In fact, it’s during this key anabolic recovery phase that the body gets stronger, faster, and builds more endurance.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis anabolic aspect of one’s training schedule—the ability of the body to efficiently recover and rebuild following each day’s workout—is as essential as the actual workout. Not only can it help propel the body towards greater athletic potential, but it can prevent injuries and illness as well.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(btw: Important note: This isn’t just about training. It’s about LIFE.

One day a 697-pound guy stopped by and checked himself in—hoping that Joe could help him transform his life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs per that story I link to above, Joe “gave him a 25-pound sandbag, and had him carry it on long hikes every morning and evening.

In addition to helping shape the fitness industry, Tony wrote a fun little book called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-big-picture-tony-horton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Big Picture\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e where he shares “11 Laws That Will Change Your Life.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first law is based on his motto “Do Your Best and Forget the Rest.” He got that from \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/don-miguel-ruiz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDon Miguel Ruiz\u003c/a\u003e’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-four-agreements-don-miguel-ruiz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e4 Agreements\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e which is kinda interesting but today I want to chat about Law #5: “Consistency Reigns Supreme.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, Tony makes the point that there are simply no “cons” to \u003cem\u003econsistency\u003c/em\u003e. Therefore, it should really be called \u003cem\u003eprosistency\u003c/em\u003e. (Hah.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut that’s not what I want to talk about. Today, I want to talk about the voices in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, again, context for those who may not know: Tony Horton is Mr. Jumbo Super Fitness. Do \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=tony+horton\u0026safe=active\u0026source=lnms\u0026tbm=isch\u0026sa=X\u0026ved=0ahUKEwiZhb_4yrfYAhVGzlQKHUGoCvMQ_AUICygC\u0026biw=1388\u0026bih=776\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ea Google Image search\u003c/a\u003e on him. The guy is jacked and has the energy of an energizer bunny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, I have a question: Do you think he’s \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e motivated to work out?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnswer: Not at all. In fact, he tells us: “Here’s a dirty little secret: I don’t get all that fired up about exercise most of the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat? Really? Mr. Health \u0026amp; Fitness Supercrusher isn’t all that fired up about exercise most of the time? You mean he’s just like you and me?! Yep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, then… Hmmm…. How in the world does he get himself to get at it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnswer: He listens to the \u003cstrong\u003eVoice of Consistency\u003c/strong\u003e and ignores the other voices in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTony tells us that, on any given day, he’ll hear from one of three voices in his head chiming in on whether or not he should work out: Devil Tony, Angel Tony and Consistent Tony. He even gives us a ratio of how often each shows up. It goes something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAngel Tony is \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e about working out. “YAH!!! Let’s *crush* this!!” That voice, apparently, is present about 21.35% of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there’s Devil Tony. Devil Tony says, “Are you kidding me? Can’t believe we have to do this right now.” He’s yelling in Tony’s ear 35.4% of the time. (Hah!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, there’s Consistent Tony. This guy is, as Tony says, \u003cem\u003e“about as exciting as a wet dish rag.”\u003c/em\u003e But he gets the job done. He’s all matter-of-fact about it and says stuff like, “All right, here we go, time to train.” Nothing flashy. Just helping him do what needs to get done. He’s talking 43.25% of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePut Mr. Angel + Mr. Consistent together and you have 64.7% on the side of the Good Guys — enough to outmuscle Mr. Devil and get the job done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1. Three parts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e#1. Let’s recognize the fact that we’re not alone in not wanting to exercise consistently (or do all the other Optimizing stuff consistently).

Even the best among us don’t \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e want to do what’s best for them. The difference, of course, is that they do it anyway.

<div class="line-clamp-2">I absolutely love the idea of *paying* to run through (and over and under and up and across) obstacles. It’s the perfect metpahor for life–which is one of the reasons why training for Spartan Races is my new sport-hobby. In this class, I share some of my favorite Big Ideas on how to become immune to obstacles in your life and, if you’re feeling it, do your first Race. The biggest obstacle you’ll face? Well, that’s Big Idea #1. :)</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I’m a big fan of Kelly McGonigal and her ability to help us apply scientific wisdom to our lives. We’ve covered two of her earlier books: The Willpower Instinct and The Upside of Stress. So... When I got this book, knew I’d enjoy it. But, I didn’t anticipate JUST how much I’d love it. We have some great Notes on Movement (Spark, Spartan Up and No Sweat among my favorites), but Kelly’s book will be our new go-to for the science of WHY exercise/movement is so essential to our well-being. It’s PHENOMENAL. Reading about the SCIENCE behind stories of transformation (and how, as per the sub-title of her book: “Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage”) also made me that much more clear on the power of what we’re doing with all of our work and the importance of focusing so much on Energy (especially with our Mastery and Coach programs). Big Ideas we explore include: Hope Molecules (and how to create them), persistence highs (and how to create them), collective effervescence (and why it's so awesome), how we endure (hint: TOGETHER!), and OMMS!!! (Obstacles (literally!) Make Me Stronger!).</div>

If you’re a triathlete you know he’s a legend. For those who might not know, Allen won the Ironman world championships an unprecedented six times. Triathlete magazine voted him the greatest triathlete of all time. You know his secret? Maffetone. In this book we get an overview of The Maffetone Method. Big Ideas we cover include the importance of remembering it's all about health AND fitness, making your workouts feel like a GIFT rather than a chore, how to build a super-strong aerobic base while burning fat for fuel and tracking it all via your #1 piece of equipment: that workout diary of yours with goals (what are yours?), strategies (yours?) and workouts (how're yours?).

<div class="line-clamp-2">Joe De Sena is the founder of the Spartan Race. He’s also, as Angela Duckworth, author of Grit, tells us: “a paragon of grit” who “shows you how you’re capable of so much more than you think.” A paragon of grit. That’s the perfect description. After inspiring us with stories of real-life heroes and ancient Spartan lore, De Sena walks us through the seven pillars of Spartan training + a 30-day plan to get Spartan Fit. Big Ideas we explore include getting to the starting line, developing obstacle immunity, making thousands of small decisions and your gritty oath.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Christopher McDougall is an extraordinary writer and this is a fascinating book. We covered his more recent book Natural Born Heroes in which he profiles World War II Cretan resistance fighters and their amazing physical feats. In this one, Christopher takes us on an incredible journey to meet a hidden tribe that can run forever (well, almost!) and an eclectic group of iconoclastic superathletes who meet them in the Copper Canyons of Mexico to run the greatest race the world has never seen. Big Ideas we cover include the secret power of glee + determination, the two goddesses (wisdom + wealth) and which one to pursue, the beast and how to love it, proper running form, and how to do super-challenging things.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Joe De Sena created Spartan Race. He's one of my favorite people on the planet. His mission? To "yank 100 million people off their couches to start living instead of being passive observers of life.” Angela Duckworth calls him a "paragon of grit" and, as you know if you've been following along, I'm ALL IN on Spartan Races as an epically awesome way to use obstacles to make ourselves stronger. We featured his first two books Spartan Up! and Spartan Fit! In this one, Joe walks us through the ten Spartan Core Virtues—from Self-Awareness and Commitment to Grit and Integrity. If you’re into embodying the classic virtues of ancient Greece as much as I am, I think you’ll dig the book as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore: A quick look at our Top 10 Spartan Virtues, how to find your True North, commitment (do you know what it *truly* is?), marshmallows (and our six-year-old sons), and what you'll know at the finish line (get there!!).</div>

We featured another one of her earlier books: Sitting Kills, Moving Heals. This book is kinda like Part 2 of that book. The theme is the same: Sit too much and you’re going to experience the same types of negative effects that astronauts experience in the microgravity of outer space. Big Ideas we explore include the fact that gravity is our friend, why we don’t want to be active AND sedentary (are you?), some stats on the health problems caused by sitting (did you know it can be as bad as smoking or drinking heavily?), and the keys to Optimizing.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Katy Bowman is the world’s leading biomechanist—helping us apply wisdom from that domain to optimizing our lives. This is a great, quick-reading, smart and funny look at how we can optimally transition from sitting all.day.long to creating a standing and dynamic (&lt;— key word!) workstation to help us optimize our whole-body health.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Christopher McDougall is a brilliant story teller (and author of Born to Run). In this great book, he weaves together a number of different narratives, with an emphasis on two: one about an extraordinary wartime adventure on Crete and the other about Natural Movement. In the process, he shares a ton of Ideas on how we can each tap into the extraordinary superpowers latent within. Big Ideas we explore include the ancient Greek meaning of the word “hero,” the mantra of the hero, why weeds + fat are optimal fuel and a great test.</div>

<p class="!pb-0">by<!-- --> <span><a class="font-normal text-red transition-colors hover:text-red-700" href="/authors/dr-philip-maffetone">Dr. Philip Maffetone</a></span></p>
<div class="line-clamp-2">Phil Maffetone is one of the greatest (if not THE) greatest endurance coaches ever. He’s coached everyone from the best triathlete in history (Mark Allen) to some of the best race car drivers (like the Andretti brothers). He even toured with The Red Hot Chilli Peppers as their wellness coach and helped Rick Rubin Optimize his life. This book is a fun look at Maffetone’s perspective on how to go about breaking the elusive 2-hour marathon. As he says in the sub-title, it’s all about “how it will go down” AND “what it can teach all runners about training and racing.” If you’re a marathoner, this might be the perfect way to get introduced to Maffetone’s core ideas. I loved it as another way to drill Maffetone’s core ideas into my mind and training methodology. It’s basically a holistic look at all the marginal gains we can apply to reach our running potential. Big Ideas we cover include a quick look at just how fast a 1:59 pace is (sub-4:35 min mile for 26.2 miles = CRAZY fast!), the importance of the MIND in hitting the target, why AEROBIC speed is so important (plus, what it is and how to train it), the ideal training schedule (is super dynamic and personal), how to run properly (hot coal technique!), and balancing the catabolic + anabolic phases of training.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Phil Maffetone is a brilliant, iconoclastic philosopher-coach. He’s one of the best endurance coaches ever and has been advocating a fat-burning approach to ultra-endurance for decades. The sub-title to this book captures the essence of all his work perfectly: “How to Achieve Your Athletic Potential, Stay Healthy and Get the Most Out of Your Body.” This "Endurance Handbook" is basically an abridged version of "The Big Book of Endurance." As I was shining a flash light into all the nooks and crannies of Maffetone’s brain that I could find (hah), I kinda thought of these two books as a sort of parallel to Epictetus’s "Discourses" (the “Big Book”!) and "Enchiridion" (the “Handbook”!). Big Ideas we explore include Rule #1 (first, do no harm!), Rule #2 (build your aerobic base!), the importance of fat burning (and how to build it), the #1 pro tip (ELIMINATE SUGAR!!!), body economy 101 (uncapping your athletic potential), and winning the ultimate endurance race: life (see you at 100!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Phil Maffetone is one of the world’s all-time great endurance coaches. In addition to coaching the best triathlete ever (Mark Allen), he’s also toured with The Red Hot Chili Peppers as their wellness coach (he considers them endurance athletes) and he’s coached legendary music producer Rick Rubin—helping him Optimize and lose over 100 pounds in the process. He’s a fascinating, iconoclastic guy who’s been preaching the power of burning fat for fuel for FOUR decades—demonstrating that it’s not only an optimal approach to endurance fitness but to our optimal health as well. In this book, Phil focuses his big brain on what he calls the “overfat” pandemic. He uses the word “overfat” to describe people who have “excess body fat sufficient to impair health.” Overweight and obese people fall into this category. AND... Even people at a “healthy” weight can be overfat. In fact, according to his research, 90% (!!!) of Americans fall into the “overfat” category. (Yikes!) We'll take a quick look at why we should care, figure out if we (and/or our loved ones) are overfat, look at the #1 cause and then focus on the solution so we can become optimalfat! :)</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Let’s talk about our feet! Our feet? YES! Our feet. Although pretty much ignored, they’re kinda important. In fact, they are, of course, literally (!) the foundation of our entire body. And, we only get one pair that needs to last our whole life so... Get this: Over 25% of our bones are found in our feet. And, did you know that each foot endures over 100,000 (!!) pounds of pressure with every mile we walk? Yep. Why should we care? Because a bunch of our biomechanical issues—from sore knees and hips and lower backs—can be traced back to sub-optimal feet. Enter: Fix Your Feet. We'll take a quick look at the #1 cause of foot problems along with the #1 solution plus some other goodness to make sure your feet (and the rest of you!) are smiling.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our second Note on one of Phil Maffetone’s books. This is called “The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing” for a reason. It’s a REALLY Big Book. (Hah!) It’s 516 pages, but the small font and two-column pages make it considerably denser; like, encyclopedically dense—which I found fantastic as I wanted to get into every nook and cranny of Phil’s brain. (Studying it was a wonderful mental-endurance workout. :) It’s essentially the distillation of over three decades (!) of clinical work with the world’s absolute best endurance athletes. Big Ideas we explore include the "Big Four" of the Big Book, the difference between aerobic and anaearobic (it's not just about oxygen!), building your superchargers (aka your mitochondria), flipping the switch to fat burning (pro tip: eliminate sugar and flour!), and stress: the good, the bad and the ugly (remember: training = work + rest!).</div>

To put it in perspective, Dr. Stephen Phinney (with his MD from Stanford and PhD from MIT) coined the phrase “keto-adapted” in 1980. Big Ideas we explore include: the accepted dogma (vs. compelling data), two fuel tanks (you want to go hours or days?), veto-adaptation (how to), protein (necessary but in moderation), fat (your most important fuel; the good and bad!), and the macro breakdown (here it is!).</div>

Part motivational manifesto and part training manual.

a big fan of Kelly McGonigal and her ability to help us apply scientific wisdom to our lives. We’ve covered two of her earlier books: The Willpower Instinct and The Upside of Stress. So... When I got this book, knew I’d enjoy it. But, I didn’t anticipate JUST how much I’d love it. We have some great Notes on Movement (Spark, Spartan Up and No Sweat among my favorites), but Kelly’s book will be our new go-to for the science of WHY exercise/movement is so essential to our well-being. It’s PHENOMENAL. Reading about the SCIENCE behind stories of transformation (and how, as per the sub-title of her book: “Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage”) also made me that much more clear on the power of what we’re doing with all of our work and the importance of focusing so much on Energy (especially with our Mastery and Coach programs). Big Ideas we explore include: Hope Molecules (and how to create them), persistence highs (and how to create them), collective effervescence (and why it's so awesome), how we endure (hint: TOGETHER!), and OMMS!!! (Obstacles (literally!) Make Me Stronger!).3b:T513,Phil Maffetone is one of the greatest (if not THE) greatest endurance coaches ever. He’s coached everyone from the best triathlete in history (Mark Allen) to some of the best race car drivers (like the Andretti brothers). He even toured with The Red Hot Chilli Peppers as their wellness coach and helped Rick Rubin Optimize his life. This book is a fun look at Maffetone’s perspective on how to go about breaking the elusive 2-hour marathon. As he says in the sub-title, it’s all about “how it will go down” AND “what it can teach all runners about training and racing.” If you’re a marathoner, this might be the perfect way to get introduced to Maffetone’s core ideas. I loved it as another way to drill Maffetone’s core ideas into my mind and training methodology. It’s basically a holistic look at all the marginal gains we can apply to reach our running potential. B"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"ig Ideas we cover include a quick look at just how fast a 1:59 pace is (sub-4:35 min mile for 26.2 miles = CRAZY fast!), the importance of the MIND in hitting the target, why AEROBIC speed is so important (plus, what it is and how to train it), the ideal training schedule (is super dynamic and personal), how to run properly (hot coal technique!), and balancing the catabolic + anabolic phases of training.3c:T4aa,Phil Maffetone is one of the world’s all-time great endurance coaches. In addition to coaching the best triathlete ever (Mark Allen), he’s also toured with The Red Hot Chili Peppers as their wellness coach (he considers them endurance athletes) and he’s coached legendary music producer Rick Rubin—helping him Optimize and lose over 100 pounds in the process. He’s a fascinating, iconoclastic guy who’s been preaching the power of burning fat for fuel for FOUR decades—demonstrating that it’s not only an optimal approach to endurance fitness but to our optimal health as well. In this book, Phil focuses his big brain on what he calls the “overfat” pandemic. He uses the word “overfat” to describe people who have “excess body fat sufficient to impair health.” Overweight and obese people fall into this category. AND... Even people at a “healthy” weight can be overfat. In fact, according to his research, 90% (!!!) of Americans fall into the “overfat” category. (Yikes!) We'll take a quick look at why we should care, figure out if we (and/or our loved ones) are overfat, look at the #1 cause and then focus on the solution so we can become optimalfat! :)3d:Td2b,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003cp\u003eI’ve mentioned the fact that I love to do 100+ burpees every day but I realized I haven’t formally introduced you to Mr. Royal H.

Quick recap: As per the Alexander Technique training I did on a tiny little island in Greece back in the day, imagine having a thread that runs from the top of your head down through your spine. Gently pull it up—lengthening (and widening) your spine. When you sit. When you stand. When you walk. All day every day. Experts in that method say that’s one of the keys to grace and poise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have \u003cstrong\u003ePower Poses\u003c/strong\u003e: I also like to think of \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/amy-cuddy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAmy Cuddy\u003c/a\u003e’s research on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/big-ideas/whats-ideal-posture-look-like/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003epower of our posture\u003c/a\u003e.

(And a little freaky.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, do you know the difference between the “anabolic” phase of training and the “catabolic” phase? Although becoming a certified trainer was one of the first things I did when I started my Optimizing adventures nearly 20 years ago, I couldn’t have told you with precision what those terms meant until I read Maffetone’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-endurance-handbook-philip-maffetone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEndurance Handbook\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the short story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you work out, you exit your comfort zone and “overload” your body. (Maffetone calls this “overreaching.”) That’s the CATABOLIC phase of training. You’re breaking yourself down. This is, of course, essential for your growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, after you work out, your body starts repairing the damage you did and, in the process, “overcompensates” and makes you stronger. That’s the ANABOLIC phase of training. You’re building yourself back up. This is, of course, essential for your growth. (In fact, this is actually where the growth occurs.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe need BOTH to be Optimized. Too much or too little of either and we’re going to run into issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich is why Maffetone incessantly repeats his formula: \u003cstrong\u003eTraining = Workout + Recovery\u003c/strong\u003e. (He also tells us that we should write that down and look at it every day which is why it’s front and center on my chalkboard these days.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe puts it this way: \u003cem\u003e“The anabolic aspect of the training schedule involves recovery; and this means getting sufficient rest. Unlike the catabolic gas pedal, the natural anabolic action is likened to the brakes that cause one to stop and take it easy. It allows the physical, chemical, and mental aspects of the body to revive themselves and fully heal. In fact, it’s during this key anabolic recovery phase that the body gets stronger, faster, and builds more endurance.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis anabolic aspect of one’s training schedule—the ability of the body to efficiently recover and rebuild following each day’s workout—is as essential as the actual workout. Not only can it help propel the body towards greater athletic potential, but it can prevent injuries and illness as well.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(btw: Important note: This isn’t just about training.
