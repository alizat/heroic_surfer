In fact, I’m going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism—along with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic. If you’re looking for “A Philosopher’s Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient,” I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did. I HIGHLY recommend it.","title":"The Stoic Challenge","pnSubtitle":"A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient","slug":"the-stoic-challenge-william-irvine","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","authorDetails":[{"__typename":"Author","id":"2572","slug":"william-b-irvine","authorName":"William B.

They just didn’t think it made a lot of sense to allow irrational thinking to create unnecessary NEGATIVE emotional experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey were incredibly (!) committed to actually LIVING their ideals and striving to be Wise people embracing their cardinal virtues of Courage, Temperance and Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecall that, not too long ago, \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/the-cardinal-virtues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ewe talked about the fact\u003c/a\u003e that positive psychologists used those four virtues as the basis of their work (while adding “Humanity” and “Transcendence”).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also talked about the fact that I see our core virtues as slight tweaks to the Stoic’s four: Wisdom + Self-Mastery (vs. “Temperance”) + Courage + Love (vs. “Justice”).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday I want to talk a little more about the LOVE side of things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough our Stoic Sages aspired to live with “Justice” by treating people fairly, to use that word as one of their cardinal virtues feels a little too sterile to me.

Summum Bonum means “the highest good.” It’s a phrase Aristotle and other classic philosophers used to capture the most important thing in life—to live with eudaimonia. How? Via Areté. Which is why this coin features a statue of the goddess Areté on the front and Aurelius’s admonition to do your best on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have the \u003cstrong\u003eAmor Fati\u003c/strong\u003e coin. Amor Fati means to “love your fate.” This one features a fire on the front which represents Aurelius’s wisdom that “\u003cem\u003eThe blazing fire makes flames and brightness out of everything thrown into it.\u003c/em\u003e” The back has a Nietzsche quote: “\u003cem\u003eNot merely to bear what is necessary… but love it.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext up we have \u003cstrong\u003eThe Obstacle Is the Way\u003c/strong\u003e coin.

What stands in the way becomes the way.\u003c/em\u003e” That quote is on the back. On the front we have a picture of a trail leading up a mountain—implying that right after we get to that peak, we should expect to climb yet another mountain immediately thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have an \u003cstrong\u003eEgo Is the Enemy\u003c/strong\u003e coin.

Premeditatio Malorum means “the pre-meditation of evils.” The ancient Stoic reminder to anticipate what can go wrong is represented by a ship in heavy seas. (Every time I look at it I smile—remembering that Zeno, the founder of \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/stoicism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eStoicism\u003c/a\u003e, arrived in Athens via shipwreck. 😲)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, finally, we have the \u003cstrong\u003eSympatheia\u003c/strong\u003e coin. This one features a globe and serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of us all. The quote on the back? Another gem from Aurelius: “\u003cem\u003eRevere the gods, and look after each other.

Practical wisdom allows us to make decisions that improve our eudaimonia, the (ethically) good life. Courage can be physical, but more broadly refers to the moral aspect—for instance, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances… Temperance makes it possible for us to control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to excesses. Justice, for Socrates and the Stoics, refers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: That’s from Part II of the book: “How to Behave in the World.” The short answer on how to behave? It’s revealed in the title of the first chapter from this section: “It’s All About Character (and Virtue).”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMassimo thoughtfully walks us through the four cardinal Stoic virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us: \u003cem\u003e“The Stoics derived their understanding of virtue from Socrates, who believed that all virtues are actually different aspects of the same underlying feature: wisdom. The reason why wisdom is the ‘chief good,’ according to Socrates, is rather simple: it is the only human ability that is good under every and all circumstance.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also connects these four cardinal virtues to the modern Positive Psychology movement which was founded on an exploration of shared virtues among all cultures—which I found particularly awesome because the next book on my stack to read is called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-power-of-character-strengths-robert-mcgrath-ryan-niemiec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Power of Character Strengths\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and was written by two of the leading scientists behind the VIA Institute on Character.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMassimo says: \u003cem\u003e“Other cultures have developed, more or less independently, their own sets of virtues as socially important character traits, each arriving at its own classification of the relations among virtues. Interestingly, though, there is much more convergence than we would expect in these days when cultural relativism is so often portrayed as the norm. A study by Katherine Dahlsgaard, Christopher Peterson, and Martin Seligman looked at how virtue is articulated in Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, and what they call ‘Athenian philosophy’ (mostly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). They found a rather surprising amount of congruence among all of these religious-philosophical traditions and identified a set of six ‘core’ virtues: Courage, Justice, Humanity, Temperance, Wisdom, and Transcendence.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFour of the six are indistinguishable from the Stoic virtues. Stoics also accepted the importance of ‘humanity’ and ‘transcendence,’ although they didn’t think of these as virtues, but rather as attitudes toward others (humanity) and toward the universe at large (transcendence).”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap and drop it into our Heroic framework.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Stoics had their four cardinal virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice. Modern scientists looked across a range of religious-philosophical doctrines across a range of cultures and found the same four virtues and added two: Humanity + Transcendence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think we can all agree that Wisdom + Courage + Temperance (or, as I prefer, Self-Mastery) are essential. Then, as we briefly discussed in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/musonius-rufus-musonius-rufus-cynthia-arrieu-king-william-irvine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eNote on Musonius Rufus\u003c/a\u003e, I think “Justice” is a very weak word to capture the LOVE the Stoics (and all other traditions) encouraged us to feel for their families, communities and world. So, why not just call the fourth virtue “Love”? Then we can throw the scientist’s “Justice” and “Humanity” under that umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow we have Wisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo run it through our Heroic model: We start by having Wisdom. We know the game we’re playing (eudaimonia!) AND, very importantly, how to play it well (operationalize virtue!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we cultivate our Self-Mastery (with an emphasis on the fundamentals so we can Optimize our Energy). Why? So we can more consistently live with both Courage (in all aspects of our lives but with an emphasis on Work) and so we can more consistently live with Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we do the hard work of operationalizing virtue, we make progress in closing the gap between who we are \u003cem\u003ecapable\u003c/em\u003e of being and who we are \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e being—more and more consistently living with eudaimonia and expressing the Optimus-best version of ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat leads us to Transcendence. From my vantage point, the eudaimonically-best version of ourselves naturally (almost \u003cem\u003eeffervescently\u003c/em\u003e) transcends self-interest and lives a life committed to more than just themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Greek word for that? Hērōs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe become modern, everyday “protectors” of our families and communities and world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have strength for two.

This is the only way our true spirit ever can be really tested—the inner spirit we have that will never consent to be ruled by outer forces. The nature of such a spirit can be seen in the fact that no prizefighter can go into a contest with high spirits if he has never been beaten black and blue. The only man who can enter the ring with confidence is one who has seen his own blood, has felt his teeth rattled by an opponent’s fist, has been tripped up and has experienced the full force of an adversary’s charge, who has been knocked down in body but not in spirit—one who, as often as he falls, gets up again with greater determination than ever.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHe even goes so far as to say in one place that:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDisaster is virtue’s opportunity.\u003c/em\u003e“\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’d like to shine a VERY BRIGHT spotlight right on that last line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e🔦\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDisaster?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s virtue’s opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a call to PRACTICE our philosophy—with more intensity than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, let’s take a quick look at our cardinal virtues and figure out how we can put them to work for us TODAY.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAncient Wisdom says, practice these four cardinal virtues: \u003cstrong\u003eWisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e– \u003cstrong\u003eWisdom\u003c/strong\u003e: We know the game we’re playing and how to play it well.

The happiness centrally valued by the Stoic is eudaimonia, or well-being—the good life rather than the good mood. But the Stoic believes that virtue gives rise to joy and to peace of mind as well. Virtue produces these good consequences as side effects. The primary mission of the Stoics, in other words, is to be helpful to others and serve the greater good, and they don’t do this to make themselves happy. They do it because it is the right and natural way to live. But doing it in that spirit, as it turns out, makes them happy.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, we’ve talked about this theme countless times, but isn’t that passage fantastic?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there’s this phrase: “\u003cem\u003ethe good life rather than the good mood.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlightly rephrased: The Good Life vs. The Good Mood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we discuss all the time, it’s \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e easy to mindlessly chase the good “mood”—not realizing that (and/or forgetting the fact that) the REALLY powerful game we want to play is to go after the GOOD LIFE.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Ward tells us, paradoxically, when we go all in on striving “to be helpful to others and serve the greater good” (without doing so trying to be happy per se), our happiness shows up as a wonderful by-product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKinda reminds me of that Viktor Frankl gem we’ve discussed before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Reminder Note: Frankl was also deeply inspired by the Stoics.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eAgain and again I therefore admonish my students in Europe and America: Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.

<div class="line-clamp-2">I love Stoicism. In this class we take a quick look at the cast of characters (from founder Zeno to Seneca + Epictetus + Marcus Aurelius) and then dive into the ultimate goal of Stoicism (hint: become bff’s with your inner daimon so you can experience a state of well-being and flourishing) along with the practices that help us apply this wisdom to our lives. We’ll create energized tranquility and equanimity as we have fun becoming our own ideal sages.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This book combines two of my favorite things: Stoicism + Ryan Holiday’s wisdom. Stoicism was one of the most influential philosophy of the Roman world and has continued to influence many of history’s greatest minds. As Ryan says: It’s time to bring it back as a powerful tool “in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance, and wisdom.” This is one of the my favorite books ever.

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fifth note on one of Ryan Holiday’s books. As I told my wife Alexandra after reading the first part of this book “Ryan is truly an INCREDIBLE writer.” As in, an ASTONISHINGLY compelling writer. He has truly mastered his craft—which is why he’s one of the world’s bestselling living philosophers whose books have sold more than four million copies. The book has three parts: Part I on Fear; Part II on Courage; and Part III on The Heroic. It’s packed with Big Ideas. Let’s explore a few my favorites now as we strive to show up with more Wisdom, Self-Mastery, COURAGE, and Love—not someday but TODAY.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Epictetus is one of three Stoic philosophers we profile (Marcus Aurelius and Seneca are the other two) and this former slave turned leading philosopher of his era is incredible. He echoes the wisdom of all the great teachers as he reminds us that, if we want to be happy, we've gotta realize the only thing we have control over is our response to a situation. We'll have fun tapping into a lot more of his vast mojo in the Note.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Epictetus is known as one of the world’s leading Stoic philosophers. (Along with Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, the three make up a very interesting bunch.) Epictetus was a former slave turned philosopher who lived from 55-135 (a little later than Seneca and before Aurelius). This book is a transcription of the informal lectures Epictetus gave to his students. It’s awesome. Big Ideas we explore: why Hercules needed challenges (and so do you), what figs can teach us about greatness, the good + the bad + the indifferent and how to tell the difference, “impressions” and the tricks they play, and the fact NOW is the time to live this stuff.</div>

In this book he tells us that life is only short if you don’t know how to use it and also gives us some tips on how to deal with challenging times and cultivate tranquility.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Musonius Rufus was one of the four great Roman Stoics. In fact, he was known as the “Roman Socrates.” To put him in historical context with the other three great Roman Stoics: He was born in AD 30, about 34 years after Seneca. He taught Epictetus (who was born in AD 55). Epictetus died in 135 but taught the guys who taught the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (who was born in AD 121) his Stoic philosophy—which is why Aurelius refers to him more than any other teacher in Meditations. Big Ideas we explore include: Theory vs. Practice (which is more important?), practicing philosophy (is where it's at!), vice vs. exile (free yourself from vice!), food (it's the medicine of life), and stoic love advice (competing in kindness).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Donald Robertson is one of the world’s leading thinkers, writers AND practitioners of Stoic philosophy. He’s also a therapist who integrates Stoicism into his work with individuals. This is our second Note on one of his great books. The first Note was on The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in which he connects the philosophical underpinnings of CBT (one of the most empirically-validated, effective modern therapies) to ancient Stoicism. This book is part biography and part philosophy. It’s all awesome. If you want to know how to think like a Roman emperor, start here. I think you’ll enjoy the book as much as I did.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Pierre Hadot was one of the most influential historians of ancient philosophy. In this book, he gives us an incredible look at Marcus Aurelius and his classic Meditations. You can feel Hadot’s incredible intellectual rigor and equally incredible passion for engaged philosophy. It’s inspiring. Big Ideas we explore include spiritual exercises, your inner citadel, your daimōn, amor fate, turning obstacles upside down and carpe areté.</div>

He is also one of the world’s most respected scholars of Stoicism. As per the inside flap, in this beautiful little (hand)book, he provides “splendid new translations and the original Greek on facing pages, a compelling introduction that sets Epictetus in context and describes the importance of Stoic freedom today, and an invaluable glossary of key words and concepts. The result is an unmatched introduction to this powerful method of managing emotions and handling life’s situations, from the most ordinary to the most demanding.” Big Ideas we explore include freedom vs. slavery, the ultimate target (progress!), wisdom daggers (ready at hand), Rule #1 of Stoicism, how to win at life and using our full powers.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Massimo Pigliucci is a Professor of Philosophy at City College of New York. He has three PhDs—one in genetics, another in evolutionary biology and a third in philosophy. And, most importantly for our purposes, he’s a practicing Stoic philosopher. In this book, Professor Pigliucci teaches us how to be a Stoic via an imaginary dialogue with Epictetus, one of the leading Stoic teachers of the ancient world. It’s a wonderfully written, super-smart look at how we can use “ancient philosophy to live a modern life.” Big Ideas we explore include an introduction to our guide Epictetus, Rule #1 of Stoicism (some things are in our power, others are not), the cardinal virtues (of Stoicism + Science + Optimize), the power of role models (and the Stoic Paradox), and the ultimate how to be a Stoic practice question: How can I use virtue here and now?</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Ward Farnsworth is the Dean of the University of Texas School of Law. As you can imagine, he brings a logical precision to his discussion of Stoicism that is distinct and powerful. (Seriously. It’s actually ASTONISHINGLY powerful.) I really enjoyed the book and I highly recommend it for the aspiring Practicing Stoic. Big Ideas we explore include Principle #1 of practical Stoicism (Judgment!), the good life vs. the good mood (virtue for the win!), what others think (← pro tip: ignore it), preferred indifference (committed but not attached), and using adversity as fuel for our Optimizing (use Hermes' magic wand!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Got problems with your soul? These days, you’d see a psychotherapist. But, back in the day, it was the philosopher who’d help you optimize—they were the preferred physician of the soul. This book is about the philosophical roots of modern psychotherapy. Specifically, it outlines the connection between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Stoicism. Big Ideas we explore include being a warrior of the mind vs. a librarian of the mind, your highest human purpose, getting on good terms with your inner daimon, practicing the reserve clause and modeling your ideal sage.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">William B. Irvine is a professor of philosophy at Wright State University. He’s also a fantastic (and prolific) writer. And… Unlike many of his academic, professor-of-philosophy peers, he is a practicing Stoic philosopher. In the words of Donald Robertson (another Stoic author and practitioner; see The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), he is both a librarian AND a warrior of the mind. We featured another one of Professor Irvine’s great books on Stoicism called A Guide to the Good Life. I enjoyed that one quite a bit but I REALLY (!) enjoyed this one. Like, jumbo loved it. In fact, I’m going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism—along with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic. If you’re looking for “A Philosopher’s Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient,” I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did. I HIGHLY recommend it.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Vice Admiral James Stockdale is an American hero. Stockdale spent nearly eight years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He spent four of those years in solitary confinement and was repeatedly tortured. He was the commanding officer of hundreds of other U.S. soldiers and received the Medal of Honor for his service beyond the call of duty. This is an incredibly inspiring look at the powerful mind and equally powerful moral commitment of a hero. Big Ideas we explore: Being our brother’s keeper, chiseling our integrity to achieve delight with life, courage as endurance of the soul and heroes vs. bums.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">James Stockdale spent 7 1/2 years as the highest ranking prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. 4 years in solitary confinement. 2 in leg irons. This book is about how he endured all of that with the wisdom of Stoic philosopher Epictetus in mind. In the Note, we explore the key tenets of Stoicism, the Stockdale Paradox, playing your role well and mastering your emotions.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Meet the enemy: Your ego. Our guide, Ryan Holiday, wrote one of my favorite books of 2015: The Obstacle Is the Way. Ego Is the Enemy is now one of my favorite books of 2016. It’s fantastic. Big Ideas we explore include: defining ego, becoming more than a flash in the pan, finally answering the question of whether it takes 10,000 or 20,000 hours to attain mastery, the virtue and value of staying true to your own path and making it rather than faking it.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fourth Note on one of Ryan Holiday’s books. Ryan is one of my absolute favorite writers. One of the testimonials in the front of the book perfectly captures my sentiment. Screenwriter and director Brian Koppelman (Rounders, Ocean’s Thirteen and Billions) puts it this way: “I don’t have many rules in life, but one I never break is: If Ryan Holiday writes a book, I read it as soon as I can get my hands on it.” (btw: Cal Newport’s the first testimonial. He says: “Some authors give advice. Ryan Holiday distills wisdom. This book is a must read.”) Penguin Random House sent me an advance copy of this book. As I knew it would be: It’s fantastic. Of course, the book’s packed with Big Ideas and I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Stoicism. I love it. Although pretty obscure today, Stoicism was once the primary philosophy of the Western world. (We’ve done Notes on the three leading Stoics: Marcus Aurelius and his Meditations, Seneca and his Letters from a Stoic, and Epictetus and his Enchiridion.) In this, Note, we’ll cover some of the essential ideas of the Stoic philosophical approach along with some Big Ideas on the art of living, the true meaning of virtue, how to visualize and the fact that we’re living in a dream world.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fourth Note on one of Tom Morris’s books. As we discussed in our Notes on True Success, The Art of Achievement, and Superheroes and Philosophy, Tom Morris got a dual Ph.D. from Yale in Philosophy and Religious Studies. Then he taught at Notre Dame for fifteen years before lecturing widely. This book combines two of my favorite things: Tom Morris’s practical, philosophical wisdom with Stoic philosophy. Big Ideas we explore include: Inner Confidence (and how to build it; remember: "Disaster is virtue's opportunity."), philosophy and what it's really about, how to deal with stress (pro tip: put it in a cosmic perspective), authentic living (and how to train it), and an emperor's wisdom for the battles of life.</div>

In the Note, we'll explore the fact that our attitudes determine our happiness and that *no one* can ever take away the freedom for us to choose our response to any given situation. We'll also look at the importance of having a mission in life and that as we serve something bigger than ourselves, our happiness and success will follow.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Tom Morris is one of my favorite modern philosophers.
He has a dual Ph.D. from Yale in both Philosophy and Religious Studies. He also taught at Notre Dame for 15 years before becoming one of the most sought-after practical philosophers. We’ve featured two of his other books in which he brings ancient wisdom to our modern lives: True Success and The Art of Achievement. (He’s also the philosopher behind Philosophy for Dummies and wrote If Aristotle Ran General Motors and If Harry Potter Ran General Electric.) I got this book after he and I had an electric chat about Optimize 2020 and the role of The Modern Hero. It’s a collection of essays written by some of the smartest and wisest academic philosophers out there. Tom edited it with his son, Matt—which makes me think of *another* book we’ve featured on the wisdom of superheroes written by a dynamic father-son duo: Deepak Chopra and his son Gotham who wrote The Seven Spiritual Laws of Superheroes. I loved diving into some of the deeper philosophical questions inherent to our modern superhero tales. If that sounds like fun, I’ll think you’ll enjoy it as well. Of course, the book is packed with Big Ideas so, KABAM! Let’s throw on our spandex tights and capes and jump straight in.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Rick Snyder was the founder of research into the science of hope. And, he was one of the pioneers of the positive psychology movement. In fact, he literally wrote the textbook on “Positive Psychology.” Big Ideas we explore include the three components of hope (goals + willpower + way power), the portrait of a high-hope person, how to create the right goals, remembering you WILL face obstacles, the power of multiple pathways and being a time traveler making a difference.</div>

Irvine is a professor of philosophy at Wright State University. He’s also a fantastic (and prolific) writer. And… Unlike many of his academic, professor-of-philosophy peers, he is a practicing Stoic philosopher. In the words of Donald Robertson (another Stoic author and practitioner; see The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), he is both a librarian AND a warrior of the mind. We featured another one of Professor Irvine’s great books on Stoicism called A Guide to the Good Life. I enjoyed that one quite a bit but I REALLY (!) enjoyed this one. Like, jumbo loved it. In fact, I’m going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism—along with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic. If you’re looking for “A Philosopher’s Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient,” I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did. I HIGHLY recommend it.3b:T4ec,Tom Morris is one of my favorite modern philosophers.\nHe has a dual Ph.D. from Yale in both Philosophy and Religious Studies.

(He’s also the philosopher behind Philosophy for Dummies and wrote If Aristotle Ran General Motors and If Harry Potter Ran General Electric.) I got this book after he and I had an electric chat about Optimize 2020 and the role of The Modern Hero. It’s a collection of essays written by some of the smartest and wisest academic philosophers out there.

Summum Bonum means “the highest good.” It’s a phrase Aristotle and other classic philosophers used to capture the most important thing in life—to live with eudaimonia. How? Via Areté. Which is why this coin features a statue of the goddess Areté on the front and Aurelius’s admonition to do your best on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have the \u003cstrong\u003eAmor Fati\u003c/strong\u003e coin.

What stands in the way becomes the way.\u003c/em\u003e” That quote is on the back. On the front we have a picture of a trail leading up a mountain—implying that right after we get to that peak, we should expect to climb yet another mountain immediately thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have an \u003cstrong\u003eEgo Is the Enemy\u003c/strong\u003e coin.

Premeditatio Malorum means “the pre-meditation of evils.” The ancient Stoic reminder to anticipate what can go wrong is represented by a ship in heavy seas. (Every time I look at it I smile—remembering that Zeno, the founder of \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/stoicism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eStoicism\u003c/a\u003e, arrived in Athens via shipwreck. 😲)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, finally, we have the \u003cstrong\u003eSympatheia\u003c/strong\u003e coin. This one features a globe and serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of us all. The quote on the back? Another gem from Aurelius: “\u003cem\u003eRevere the gods, and look after each other.

Practical wisdom allows us to make decisions that improve our eudaimonia, the (ethically) good life. Courage can be physical, but more broadly refers to the moral aspect—for instance, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances… Temperance makes it possible for us to control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to excesses. Justice, for Socrates and the Stoics, refers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: That’s from Part II of the book: “How to Behave in the World.” The short answer on how to behave? It’s revealed in the title of the first chapter from this section: “It’s All About Character (and Virtue).”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMassimo thoughtfully walks us through the four cardinal Stoic virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us: \u003cem\u003e“The Stoics derived their understanding of virtue from Socrates, who believed that all virtues are actually different aspects of the same underlying feature: wisdom. The reason why wisdom is the ‘chief good,’ according to Socrates, is rather simple: it is the only human ability that is good under every and all circumstance.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also connects these four cardinal virtues to the modern Positive Psychology movement which was founded on an exploration of shared virtues among all cultures—which I found particularly awesome because the next book on my stack to read is called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-power-of-character-strengths-robert-mcgrath-ryan-niemiec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Power of Character Strengths\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and was written by two of the leading scientists behind the VIA Institute on Character.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMassimo says: \u003cem\u003e“Other cultures have developed, more or less independently, their own sets of virtues as socially important character traits, each arriving at its own classification of the relations among virtues. Interestingly, though, there is much more convergence than we would expect in these days when cultural relativism is so often portrayed as the norm. A study by Katherine Dahlsgaard, Christopher Peterson, and Martin Seligman looked at how virtue is articulated in Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, and what they call ‘Athenian philosophy’ (mostly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). They found a rather surprising amount of congruence among all of these religious-philosophical traditions and identified a set of six ‘core’ virtues: Courage, Justice, Humanity, Temperance, Wisdom, and Transcendence.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFour of the six are indistinguishable from the Stoic virtues. Stoics also accepted the importance of ‘humanity’ and ‘transcendence,’ although they didn’t think of these as virtues, but rather as attitudes toward others (humanity) and toward the universe at large (transcendence).”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap and drop it into our Heroic framework.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Stoics had their four cardinal virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice. Modern scientists looked across a range of religious-philosophical doctrines across a range of cultures and found the same four virtues and added two: Humanity + Transcendence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think we can all agree that Wisdom + Courage + Temperance (or, as I prefer, Self-Mastery) are essential. Then, as we briefly discussed in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/musonius-rufus-musonius-rufus-cynthia-arrieu-king-william-irvine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eNote on Musonius Rufus\u003c/a\u003e, I think “Justice” is a very weak word to capture the LOVE the Stoics (and all other traditions) encouraged us to feel for their families, communities and world. So, why not just call the fourth virtue “Love”? Then we can throw the scientist’s “Justice” and “Humanity” under that umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow we have Wisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo run it through our Heroic model: We start by having Wisdom. We know the game we’re playing (eudaimonia!) AND, very importantly, how to play it well (operationalize virtue!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we cultivate our Self-Mastery (with an emphasis on the fundamentals so we can Optimize our Energy). Why? So we can more consistently live with both Courage (in all aspects of our lives but with an emphasis on Work) and so we can more consistently live with Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we do the hard work of operationalizing virtue, we make progress in closing the gap between who we are \u003cem\u003ecapable\u003c/em\u003e of being and who we are \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e being—more and more consistently living with eudaimonia and expressing the Optimus-best version of ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat leads us to Transcendence. From my vantage point, the eudaimonically-best version of ourselves naturally (almost \u003cem\u003eeffervescently\u003c/em\u003e) transcends self-interest and lives a life committed to more than just themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Greek word for that? Hērōs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe become modern, everyday “protectors” of our families and communities and world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have strength for two.

The nature of such a spirit can be seen in the fact that no prizefighter can go into a contest with high spirits if he has never been beaten black and blue. The only man who can enter the ring with confidence is one who has seen his own blood, has felt his teeth rattled by an opponent’s fist, has been tripped up and has experienced the full force of an adversary’s charge, who has been knocked down in body but not in spirit—one who, as often as he falls, gets up again with greater determination than ever.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHe even goes so far as to say in one place that:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDisaster is virtue’s opportunity.\u003c/em\u003e“\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’d like to shine a VERY BRIGHT spotlight right on that last line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e🔦\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDisaster?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s virtue’s opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a call to PRACTICE our philosophy—with more intensity than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, let’s take a quick look at our cardinal virtues and figure out how we can put them to work for us TODAY.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAncient Wisdom says, practice these four cardinal virtues: \u003cstrong\u003eWisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e– \u003cstrong\u003eWisdom\u003c/strong\u003e: We know the game we’re playing and how to play it well.

The happiness centrally valued by the Stoic is eudaimonia, or well-being—the good life rather than the good mood. But the Stoic believes that virtue gives rise to joy and to peace of mind as well. Virtue produces these good consequences as side effects. The primary mission of the Stoics, in other words, is to be helpful to others and serve the greater good, and they don’t do this to make themselves happy. They do it because it is the right and natural way to live. But doing it in that spirit, as it turns out, makes them happy.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, we’ve talked about this theme countless times, but isn’t that passage fantastic?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there’s this phrase: “\u003cem\u003ethe good life rather than the good mood.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlightly rephrased: The Good Life vs. The Good Mood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we discuss all the time, it’s \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e easy to mindlessly chase the good “mood”—not realizing that (and/or forgetting the fact that) the REALLY powerful game we want to play is to go after the GOOD LIFE.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Ward tells us, paradoxically, when we go all in on striving “to be helpful to others and serve the greater good” (without doing so trying to be happy per se), our happiness shows up as a wonderful by-product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKinda reminds me of that Viktor Frankl gem we’ve discussed before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Reminder Note: Frankl was also deeply inspired by the Stoics.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eAgain and again I therefore admonish my students in Europe and America: Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.

In this book, Professor Pigliucci teaches us how to be a Stoic via an imaginary dialogue with Epictetus, one of the leading Stoic teachers of the ancient world. It’s a wonderfully written, super-smart look at how we can use “ancient philosophy to live a modern life.” Big Ideas we explore include an introduction to our guide Epictetus, Rule #1 of Stoicism (some things are in our power, others are not), the cardinal virtues (of Stoicism + Science + Optimize), the power of role models (and the Stoic Paradox), and the ultimate how to be a Stoic practice question: How can I use virtue here and now?\",\"title\":\"How to Be a Stoic\",\"pnSubtitle\":\"Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life\",\"slug\":\"how-to-be-a-stoic-massimo-pigliucci\",\"authorizationState\":\"FREECONTENT\",\"authorDetails\":[{\"__typename\":\"Author\",\"id\":\"3142\",\"slug\":\"massimo-pigliucci\",\"authorName\":\"Massimo Pigliucci\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/massimo-pigliucci.jpg\",\"tagline\":\"Prof. of Philosophy at City College, evolutionary biologist, student of Stoicism.
