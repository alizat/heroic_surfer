The entire cruise takes about a minute, and the overall numbers are staggering. Inside each of our 25 trillion red blood cells are 270 million hemoglobin, each of which has room for four oxygen molecules. That’s a billion molecules of oxygen boarding and disembarking within each red blood cell.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere’s nothing controversial about this process of respiration and the role of carbon dioxide in gas exchange.

It’s not more air. What we need is more carbon dioxide.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAHA!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone thinks they need more OXYGEN in their bodies and think that the more they breathe the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs it turns out, just like you can EAT too much, you can BREATHE too much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, every healthy cell is fueled by oxygen. And, as James says, the numbers are STAGGERING.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have 25 trillion red blood cells. Each of those has 270 million hemoglobin which each have room for four oxygen molecules. That’s ONE BILLION molecules of oxygen in all 270 million hemoglobin. Multiply that by 25 trillion and we have a LOT of oxygen in our bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuick calculator math says: 25 trillion x 270 million x 4 = 2.7e+22. That’s a lot of zeroes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOptimal breathing isn’t about the OXYGEN per se. All healthy bodies are properly saturated with more than enough oxygen. It’s all about the CARBON DIOXIDE that needs to be present to basically push the oxygen out of the hemoglobin into the cells that need it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe talked about this in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-oxygen-advantage-patrick-mckeown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Oxygen Advantage\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e where Patrick McKeown tells us: \u003cem\u003e“The crucial point to remember is that hemoglobin releases oxygen when in the presence of carbon dioxide. When we overbreathe, too much carbon dioxide is washed from the lungs, blood, tissues, and cells. This condition is called hypocapnia, causing the hemoglobin to hold on to oxygen, resulting in reduced oxygen release and therefore reduced oxygen delivery to tissues and organs. With less oxygen delivered to the muscles, they cannot work as effectively as we might like them to. As counterintuitive as it may seem, the urge to take bigger, deeper breaths when we hit the wall during exercise does not provide the muscles with more oxygen but effectively reduces oxygenation even further. In contrast, when breathing volume remains nearer to correct levels, the pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood is higher, loosening the bond between hemoglobin and oxygen and facilitating the delivery of oxygen to the muscles and organs… In light of the Bohr Effect, overbreathing limits the release of oxygen from the blood, and in turn affects how well our muscles are able to work.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePatrick also succinctly says: “\u003cem\u003eSo how do we ensure that we breathe correctly so as to make optimal use of our amazing respiratory system? As odd as this may seem, it’s not oxygen that exerts the primary influence on your breathing efficiency, but carbon dioxide.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou know how we achieve that?

Without further adieu, here they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. Do it with\n2. Dignity and a\n3. Defined anchor with strong\n4. Determination then\n5. Do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first most obvious rule of meditation? DO IT!!! At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter WHAT you do (or how you do it) but THAT you do it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter picking your flavor of meditation, do it with DIGNITY. I love \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/jon-kabat-zinn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eJon Kabat-Zinn\u003c/a\u003e’s wisdom on the subject. Wonder how to sit? Sit with dignity. You and Optimus, sitting nice and tall (spine straight!) yet relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we want to DEFINE OUR ANCHOR. What does a ship out at sea do when it wants to stay in the same spot? It drops an anchor, right? Well, same with us. We need an anchor on which to focus our attention. It can be your breath, a mantra, a prayer, or whatever you’d like. But… DEFINE the anchor. Then, when your mind inevitably (!) wanders, just say, “Oh, well” and get back to your chosen focus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we decided to do it with dignity and a defined anchor, we’d be wise to do it with DETERMINATION. Specifically, STRONG DETERMINATION. I got that phrase from \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/s-n-goenka/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSN Goenka\u003c/a\u003e during one of his organization’s 10-day silent meditation retreats. Basic idea: Once you commit to a time, set your timer then assume your posture then resolve not to open your eyes, your hands or your legs for the duration of your session. Feel an itch on your nose? Ignore it. Curious how much longer you have to go? Forget about it. Legs feeling weird? Unless something’s truly wrong, ignore it. That’s strong determination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s meditation is complete. Fantastic. Congratulations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fifth D? Do it again tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRepeat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 5 D’s of Meditation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo it with Dignity and a Defined anchor with strong Determination then Do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow’s YOUR meditation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Btw: That meditation with Emerson?

Swimmers, as he pointed out, are notorious for their use of dominant body language in the moments before races, not only to signal their power to their competitors but also to loosen their muscles and pump themselves up. Sometimes they will literally pound their chests, like gorillas.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Breathing. It’s easy to take for granted but when you stop to think about it, it quickly becomes obvious just how powerful it is. Get this: You can live for weeks without food and days without water but, of course, only minutes without oxygen. Plus: Your brain uses 20% of the oxygen you consume while breathing is responsible for 70% (!) of your body’s detoxification. Yet… If you’re like most people, you’re probably doing this simple, should-be-easy fundamental wrong. In this class, we’ll look at why CO2 is (somewhat paradoxically!) actually the variable we want to be Optimizing if we want to get the O2 out of our hemoglobin and into our cells. Then we’ll look at the Three Rules for breathing perfectly as we Optimize your breathing for calm, focused energy.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Patrick McKeown is one of the world’s leading teachers of the Buteyko Breathing Method which was created in the 1950s by a Russian doctor named Dr. Konstantin Buteyko. McKeown suffered from asthma for decades until he found the Buteyko Method. At which point, he reversed his asthma symptoms and then dedicated his life to helping others optimize their breathing. In this book, he extends the Buteyko Method into an approach he calls the Oxygen Advantage.

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our first note on a book by Wim Hof, who you may know as "The Iceman." He holds multiple world records for his feats of endurance and exposure to cold. And, as you may not know, the effectiveness of his methods—which are now practiced by millions—have been validated by eight university research studies. This book is a great way to learn more about just how powerful his method integrating cold, breath and the power of our minds can be.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Eric Goodman is the creator of Foundation Training. If you’ve ever had back or neck or other physical pain, this book might be just what your doctor forgot to order. And, of course, if you’re just looking to take your energy to the next level, this is a gem. In the Note, we take a quick look at why gravity + sitting/bad posture = compression and why that’s so bad plus how to deal with it as we become fluent in a new movement language and have fun becoming perpetual motion machines.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Breathing. It’s obviously important. And... I’m beginning to realize *just* how important it is. In fact, breathing properly is quickly becoming my #1 fundamental. Belisa Vranich is a clinical psychologist and one of the world’s leading experts on how to breathe right. In this Note, we take a quick peek at why breathing is so important, learn how to measure your Vital Lung Capacity, observe the difference between Clark Kent and Superman and get to work on training the most important and underappreciated muscle in your body (hint: your diaphragm).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Al Lee and Don Campbell are breathwork practitioners, researchers and lecturers. The underlying theme of the book is the fact that our breath is THE primary connection between our mental, physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. Big Ideas we explore include the two key facets to perfect breathing: 1. Breath awareness + 2. Conscious breathing, how to breathe right (hint: nice and deep!), the fact that your breath is responsible for 70% (!) of your detoxing, the inverse relationship between attentional and emotional pathways in your brain and how to optimize the gap between your first and last breaths.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the fourth book of Jim Loehr’s we’ve featured so far. Written in 1986, it’s a bit old school (gotta love references to VHS tapes) and it’s currently out of print but I found it in our home library (Alexandra bought it over a decade ago) and I figured it would be perfect as part of my prep for Optimal Breathing 101. It didn’t disappoint. Big Ideas we explore include: how to breathe for maximum achievement, 7X-ing your oxygen, how to drop the impatience (+ a Johnson family practice), alternate nostril breathing and the key to peak performance.</div>

If you suffer from anxiety and/or panic attacks, this might be a great place to start. Big Ideas we explore: The #1 rule of breathing, the 2 key benefits of putting your attention on your breath, why CO2 is your friend and how to play nice, avoiding rat poison and becoming a good mind gardener.</div>

They simply adapt better to their ever-shifting circumstances, albeit completely at nonconscious levels. Physically, they regulate their internal bodily processes more efficiently, like their glucose levels and inflammation. Mentally they’re better able to regulate their attention and emotions, even their behavior. Socially, they’re especially skillful in navigating interpersonal interactions and in forging positive connections with others. By definition, then, they experience more micro-moments of love. It’s as though the agility of the conduit between the brains and the hearts—as reflected in their high vagal tone—allows them to be exquisitely agile, attuned, and flexible as they navigate the ups and downs of day-to-day life and social exchanges.

(Think: Lion chasing you.)\n– Third: When you breathe through your mouth, you tend to “overbreathe” via short, shallow, fast breaths that disrupt the oxygen to carbon dioxide levels in your body. Although it might sound weird, it’s the CARBON DIOXIDE that actually gets the oxygen out of your red blood cells and into your tissues and organs and you need to slow down your breathing (via your nose!) to get the CO2 right and, as a result, the O2 where you want it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRule #2.

When we overbreathe, too much carbon dioxide is washed from the lungs, blood, tissues, and cells. This condition is called hypocapnia, causing the hemoglobin to hold on to oxygen, resulting in reduced oxygen release and therefore reduced oxygen delivery to tissues and organs. With less oxygen delivered to the muscles, they cannot work as effectively as we might like them to. As counterintuitive as it may seem, the urge to take bigger, deeper breaths when we hit the wall during exercise does not provide the muscles with more oxygen but effectively reduces oxygenation even further. In contrast, when breathing volume remains nearer to correct levels, the pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood is higher, loosening the bond between hemoglobin and oxygen and facilitating the delivery of oxygen to the muscles and organs… In light of the Bohr Effect, overbreathing limits the release of oxygen from the blood, and in turn affects how well our muscles are able to work.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePatrick also succinctly says: “\u003cem\u003eSo how do we ensure that we breathe correctly so as to make optimal use of our amazing respiratory system?

I handed him the pearl I was holding during that session and he put the meditation blanket around him as he sat on my lap quietly for the last 15 minutes or so of my meditation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat was the first time we’ve meditated like that since he was so small he’d fit in a wrap on my chest. It was awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich leads us to the point of Today’s +1: The 5 D’s of Meditation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStepping back for a moment…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sub-title of our “Be Present” session was “An 80/20 Look at How to Focus Your Soul Force on the Only Moment That Matters.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe talked about the fact that, basically, EVERYTHING we ever do together is to get us Energized and ready to be our Optimus best RIGHT NOW. We also talked about the fact that all we ever truly have is RIGHT.THIS.SECOND so… We’d be wise to give this moment our best, etc., etc., etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter chatting about some other high-level stuff, we moved into three practices to train our presence. The first was all about Digital Minimalism and The Smartphone Effect. The second was all about Meditation. (The third practice was about cultivating one-pointed attention by Doing One Thing at a Time.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have a whole class on \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/optimize/101/meditation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMeditation 101\u003c/a\u003e, but for the purposes of that session (and this +1!), I boiled down the essence of Meditation into 5 D’s. Without further adieu, here they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. Do it with\n2. Dignity and a\n3. Defined anchor with strong\n4. Determination then\n5. Do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first most obvious rule of meditation? DO IT!!! At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter WHAT you do (or how you do it) but THAT you do it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter picking your flavor of meditation, do it with DIGNITY.

Sit with dignity. You and Optimus, sitting nice and tall (spine straight!) yet relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we want to DEFINE OUR ANCHOR. What does a ship out at sea do when it wants to stay in the same spot? It drops an anchor, right? Well, same with us. We need an anchor on which to focus our attention. It can be your breath, a mantra, a prayer, or whatever you’d like. But… DEFINE the anchor. Then, when your mind inevitably (!) wanders, just say, “Oh, well” and get back to your chosen focus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we decided to do it with dignity and a defined anchor, we’d be wise to do it with DETERMINATION. Specifically, STRONG DETERMINATION. I got that phrase from \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/s-n-goenka/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSN Goenka\u003c/a\u003e during one of his organization’s 10-day silent meditation retreats. Basic idea: Once you commit to a time, set your timer then assume your posture then resolve not to open your eyes, your hands or your legs for the duration of your session. Feel an itch on your nose? Ignore it. Curious how much longer you have to go? Forget about it. Legs feeling weird? Unless something’s truly wrong, ignore it. That’s strong determination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s meditation is complete. Fantastic. Congratulations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fifth D?

Swimmers, as he pointed out, are notorious for their use of dominant body language in the moments before races, not only to signal their power to their competitors but also to loosen their muscles and pump themselves up. Sometimes they will literally pound their chests, like gorillas.
