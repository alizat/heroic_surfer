One eye’s open, the other one’s shut—allowing half their brains to sleep while the other half gets a reboot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s even more astonishing is that if you get a bunch of birds together and observe their sleep you might just see them line up in a row with the birds on the inside enjoying two-eyes-shut full sleep while the birds on the ends have one eye open and half their brains asleep. Best part? Midway through the sleep session the birds on the end will turn the other direction and shut the other eye to give the other half of their brain some sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow’s that relate to us?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ea) We’d be wise to remember that anything THAT universal MUST have an incredibly strong evolutionary reason for its existence.

It is hard not to do so with such compelling masses of studies in the field of sleep deprivation. Often, however, a single astonishing result is all the people need to apprehend the point. For cardiovascular health, I believe that finding comes from a ‘global experiment’ in which 1.5 billion people are forced to reduce their sleep by one hour or less for a single night each year. It is very likely that you have been part of this experiment, otherwise known as daylight savings time.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn the Northern Hemisphere, the switch to daylight savings time in March results in most people losing an hour of sleep opportunity. Should you tabulate millions of daily hospital records, as researchers have done, you discover that this seemingly trivial sleep reduction comes with a frightening spike in heart attacks the following day. Impressively, it works both ways. In the autumn within the Northern Hemisphere, when the clocks move forward and we gain an hour of sleep opportunity time, rates of heart attacks plummet the day after. A similar rise-and-fall relationship can be seen with the number of traffic accidents, proving that the brain, by way of attention lapses and micro-sleeps, is just as sensitive as the heart to very small perturbations of sleep. Most people think nothing of losing an hour of sleep for a single night, believing it to be trivial and inconsequential.

This is called the glymphatic system. To make room for the fluid to wash out your brain, your cells actually shrink in size when you are in deep sleep. This allows the full ‘brain wash’ process to go twenty times as fast when you are in deep sleep as when you are awake and helps explain why a good night’s sleep is so restorative. When you get an adequate amount of deep sleep, you literally wake up with a refreshed and rejuvenated mind that has been swept clean of junk and debris.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve all heard of our \u003cem\u003elymphatic\u003c/em\u003e system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an essential part of our immune system featuring a clear fluid called “lymph” that helps rid our bodies of toxins, waste and other unwanted materials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut… What about our \u003cem\u003eglymphatic\u003c/em\u003e system?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI never really paid attention to it until I read this book.

He tells us: “\u003cem\u003eThe glymphatic system is most active during the specific stage of deep sleep that happens very early in the sleep cycle. And the glymphatic system, just like your digestive system, requires a great deal of blood flow. This means that if you eat too soon before going to bed, your blood will all flow to your gut to aid in digestion and will not be able to reach your brain to complete the all-important brain wash.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us that this “brain wash cycle” is probably the “\u003cem\u003esingle most overlooked and misunderstood aspect of neurodegenerative diseases.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also tells us that, luckily, there’s a simple solution: “\u003cem\u003eLeaving as big a gap as possible between your last meal of the day and your bedtime.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis specific recommendation?

I doubt you’re surprised by this fact, but you may be surprised by the consequences. Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system, more than doubling your risk of cancer.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Q: Where do you fall in those statistics?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd now for the Top 10 Sleep Kryptonites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eSimply not valuing sleep\u003c/strong\u003e. This is where it all starts. If you don’t REALLY get just how important sleep is then you’ll never change your priorities to make sure you’re getting enough sleep. (Right?)\n2. \u003cstrong\u003eInconsistency\u003c/strong\u003e. All the leading sleep gurus (including Matthew) tell us that CONSISTENCY is key. In fact, this is his #1 tip: “\u003cem\u003eStick to a sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. … Set an alarm for bedtime. Often we set an alarm for when it’s time to wake up but fail to do so for when it’s time to go to sleep. If there is only one piece of advice you remember and take from these 12 tips, this should be it.\u003c/em\u003e”\n3. \u003cstrong\u003eScreens\u003c/strong\u003e. 90% of adults are on their electronic devices within an hour of going to sleep. That’s a really bad idea. Unless you like having a bad night of sleep. 😲 Solution is easy: \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/digital-sunset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDigital sunset\u003c/a\u003e!!

We’re too stressed. Well… Guess what? If we structure our lives such that we’re basically redlining our energy all day every day, we’re going to have a lot of “Enervated Anxiety” and it will be really hard to magically flip the “Off” switch when our heads hit the pillow. Solution? Train yourself to flip the switch and get really good at creating a sense of Energized Tranquility.\n5. \u003cstrong\u003eCaffeine\u003c/strong\u003e. Caffeine works because it basically \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/how-caffeine-really-works/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003emasks your fatigue\u003c/a\u003e. It has a half-life of 5-6 hours—which means that if you have 100 mg of caffeine at 4:00 pm, around half of that caffeine is still having a party in your brain at 10:00 pm. Not helpful for sleep. Solution: Create a caffeine curfew. Stop consumption after 2:00 (or noon) (or whatever is your ideal).\n6. \u003cstrong\u003eAlcohol\u003c/strong\u003e. You may \u003cem\u003ethink\u003c/em\u003e you sleep better after drinking but, well, you don’t.\n7. \u003cstrong\u003eTobacco\u003c/strong\u003e. Tobacco is a stimulant.

If you eat a big meal before bedtime, your body needs to work too hard digesting food when it \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e be doing all the important repair work. Minimum goal should be to eat your last meal at least 2 hours before bedtime.

Your sleep environment matters. A lot. Key things to Optimize? Temperature should be around 65 degrees. It should be SUPER dark. Blackout curtains for the win. And, of course, make it quiet. (Oh!

I view it as a form of credit, similar to shopping with a credit card. You get energy now that you don’t actually have, but you pay for it later—when the ‘bill,’ or fatigue, hits. (Simply drinking more coffee to put off the inevitable is like paying off one credit card with another: It will catch up with you sooner or later.) You’ll most likely pay a high interest rate as well, needing more time to recover than if that energy had not been borrowed in the first place.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Matthew Walker is one of the world’s leading neuroscientists and sleep experts. He’s a professor at UC Berkeley (and former professor at Harvard) who has spent decades studying why we sleep and how to, as per the sub-title of this book, unlock the power of sleep and dreams. As you know if you’ve been following along, I’m a HUGE advocate of Optimizing our sleep as a fundamental practice in Optimizing our lives. This book has made me EVEN MORE bullish about the power of sleep. The consequences of chronically depriving ourselves of the sleep we need? Well, they’re astonishingly devastating—dramatically increasing the odds of having everything from mood disorders to cancer (and everything else we don’t want). Big Ideas we explore include the fact that you're more likely to get struck by lightning than have the gene that let's you get by on less than the recommended sleep, the universality of sleep (even worms sleep!!), resetting baselines, the iPad effect (did you know how much using one before sleep messes w/your melatonin?), and some tips to Optimize your sleep TONIGHT!!!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Arianna Huffington (CEO of Thrive and co-founder + editor in chief of The Huffington Post) went from being a sleep-deprived executive to a sleep evangelist after passing out and banging her head following years of a grueling work! In this book, she brilliantly walks us through the crisis we’re facing, the history of sleep, the science of sleep and, most importantly, what we can do to Optimize our sleep. I highly recommend it. Big Ideas we explore include the fact that sleep is the #1 most underrated health habit, how to master sleeping well, the #1 tip (and #2-4), how much sleep the wealthiest human on the planet gets (hint: target: 8!), how athletes train their sleep (guess what time Tom Brady goes to sleep!), and why you should set a WORK-DOWN alarm so you don't need a WAKE-UP alarm.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Alex Pang is the founder of the Restful Company. In this book, he brilliantly walks us through the science of why rest is an unequivocally essential part of doing truly great work. He integrates the latest findings in neuroscience with compelling and inspiring stories of historical exemplars who leveraged rest to achieve greatness. It’s awesome. Big Ideas we explore include an introduction to your default mode network (aka what your brain does when it's "resting"), your new four-hour workday (that's what the great do), the importance of early starts (and rhythms), why walking and (aerobic) exercise are so powerful for creativity (hint: blood to brain!!), and the importance of deep play (aka making your work AND play one big game).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Did you know that 65% of us will have trouble falling asleep tonight and be tired tomorrow? And sleep deprivation costs the United States $66 BILLION annually. That’s a lot of people. And a lot of money. Dr. James B. Maas is one of the world’s leading researchers and educators in the sleep world. He’s been at this for nearly FIVE decades and has taught more than 65,000 students and thousands of executives about the importance of sleep. Big Ideas we cover include the top six sleep thieves, the 4 rules of optimal sleep, and finding the time to get that extra hour we need.</div>

Dr. Steven Gundry is a former heart surgeon (plus professor and head of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda University School of Medicine) who makes a compelling case for the idea that we need to invest a lot more time Optimizing the most ancient part of ourselves (our microbiome) if we want to extend both our life span AND our health span (aka die “young” at that ripe old age). Big Ideas we explore include genes vs. microbiome (which one matters more?), long-lived peoples (do and don't!), chronic cardio (equals chronic stress), your two brains (head + gut... which one's #1?), and got glymph? (how to wash your brain!).</div>

<p class="!pb-0">by<!-- --> <span><a class="font-normal text-red transition-colors hover:text-red-700" href="/authors/satchin-panda-phd">Satchin Panda, PhD</a></span></p>
<div class="line-clamp-2">Satchin Panda is one of the world’s leading researchers in the field of circadian biology. This book is a FANTASTIC distillation of what he and his colleagues have discovered and how we can apply those insights to our modern lives. I highly recommend it. Want to, as per the sub-title of the book, “lose weight, supercharge your energy, and transform your health?” Then pay attention to your body’s infinitely wise internal clock!! As Dr. Panda tells us: “The Circadian Code is a revolution in the way you think about diet, exercise, work, learning, and technology. Instead of counting calories or limiting food choices, you will learn that there is a right time to eat so that you can actually burn calories while you sleep. There is also a best time of day to exercise, to work, and to rest. Your body already knows this code: you just have to become aware of it and then follow its rhythm.” I’m excited to share some of my favorite Big Ideas so let’s jump straight in!</div>

It is hard not to do so with such compelling masses of studies in the field of sleep deprivation. Often, however, a single astonishing result is all the people need to apprehend the point. For cardiovascular health, I believe that finding comes from a ‘global experiment’ in which 1.5 billion people are forced to reduce their sleep by one hour or less for a single night each year. It is very likely that you have been part of this experiment, otherwise known as daylight savings time.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn the Northern Hemisphere, the switch to daylight savings time in March results in most people losing an hour of sleep opportunity. Should you tabulate millions of daily hospital records, as researchers have done, you discover that this seemingly trivial sleep reduction comes with a frightening spike in heart attacks the following day. Impressively, it works both ways. In the autumn within the Northern Hemisphere, when the clocks move forward and we gain an hour of sleep opportunity time, rates of heart attacks plummet the day after. A similar rise-and-fall relationship can be seen with the number of traffic accidents, proving that the brain, by way of attention lapses and micro-sleeps, is just as sensitive as the heart to very small perturbations of sleep. Most people think nothing of losing an hour of sleep for a single night, believing it to be trivial and inconsequential.

This is called the glymphatic system. To make room for the fluid to wash out your brain, your cells actually shrink in size when you are in deep sleep. This allows the full ‘brain wash’ process to go twenty times as fast when you are in deep sleep as when you are awake and helps explain why a good night’s sleep is so restorative.

This is where it all starts. If you don’t REALLY get just how important sleep is then you’ll never change your priorities to make sure you’re getting enough sleep. (Right?)\n2. \u003cstrong\u003eInconsistency\u003c/strong\u003e. All the leading sleep gurus (including Matthew) tell us that CONSISTENCY is key. In fact, this is his #1 tip: “\u003cem\u003eStick to a sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. … Set an alarm for bedtime. Often we set an alarm for when it’s time to wake up but fail to do so for when it’s time to go to sleep.

We’re too stressed. Well… Guess what? If we structure our lives such that we’re basically redlining our energy all day every day, we’re going to have a lot of “Enervated Anxiety” and it will be really hard to magically flip the “Off” switch when our heads hit the pillow. Solution? Train yourself to flip the switch and get really good at creating a sense of Energized Tranquility.\n5. \u003cstrong\u003eCaffeine\u003c/strong\u003e.

It has a half-life of 5-6 hours—which means that if you have 100 mg of caffeine at 4:00 pm, around half of that caffeine is still having a party in your brain at 10:00 pm. Not helpful for sleep. Solution: Create a caffeine curfew. Stop consumption after 2:00 (or noon) (or whatever is your ideal).\n6. \u003cstrong\u003eAlcohol\u003c/strong\u003e.

(Simply drinking more coffee to put off the inevitable is like paying off one credit card with another: It will catch up with you sooner or later.) You’ll most likely pay a high interest rate as well, needing more time to recover than if that energy had not been borrowed in the first place.
