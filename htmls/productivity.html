Cal uses Carl Jung as an example of this style. Jung had a very active therapy practice AND he had a hermit-like retreat house out of town he’d go to for Deep Work. Bimodal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eRhythmic.\u003c/strong\u003e This style is all about finding a consistent \u003cem\u003erhythm\u003c/em\u003e of Deep Work. You may not be able to go full-Hermit on it, but you CAN find that hour before everyone gets up or before you go into email or fill-in-the-blank with YOUR favorite time. Find that time. Protect it.

Here’s a quick look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 1.\u003c/strong\u003e Drucker tells us that most people start by PLANNING their time. “Oh, to hit my goals I’ll do this at 9am and this at noon and this at 3pm” kinda thing. He says that’s not wise. Instead, we want to start by TRACKING our time. We need to get more clarity on where our time is currently going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we’ve discussed a number of times, the simple act of tracking ANYTHING immediately improves the performance of that activity. For example, if you’re tracking your nutrition, you’re less likely to want to write down “Three Twinkies for lunch.” Right? Same thing with our time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe need to know where it’s going.

The #1 thing we do in this part of the process? We RUTHLESSLY (!!!) eliminate the time wasters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, Rule #1 of Optimizing \u003cem\u003eanything\u003c/em\u003e — whether it’s your health or your relationships or your time — is to GET RID OF the stuff that’s making you sick. Twinkies? Gone. Yelling? Gone. Smartphone apps? Gone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter eliminating the time wasters we then architect our Masterpiece Days and start planning our time. Which leads us to…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 3.\u003c/strong\u003e Consolidate your time. Drucker is ALL about creating “large quantums of time.” The largest possible blocks of time to do truly deep, important work. For him, that doesn’t mean 90-minute chunks. It means “half-days” and TWO WEEKS of uninterrupted time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWho does that?!

<div class="line-clamp-2">Peter Drucker is considered the father of modern management. This book was originally published in 1967. It’s *remarkably* well written and lucid. And, of course, packed with Big Ideas on how to optimize our effectiveness. We cover the 5 key practices/habits of the effective executive: time (first things first; second things never!), contribution (what can you contribute?), strengths (make yours productive; make weaknesses irrelevant), concentration (the secret to effectiveness), decisions (boundary conditions help).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Charles Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize-winning NY Times journalist (and Harvard MBA) who wrote the best-selling book The Power of Habit in which he walked us through the science of building better habits. In this book, he walks us through the science of being productive so we can be smarter, faster and better at everything we do. It’s a great book packed with fascinating stories and practical applications. Big Ideas we explore include the 2 keys to motivation, how to build your focus, the best way to set goals (think: Stretch + SMART), why disfluency helps learning and how productivity is all about choices.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Kevin Kruse is a Forbes Leadership columnist and successful entrepreneur. He’s built and sold several multimillion dollar technology companies, winning both Inc 500 and Best Place to Work awards along the way. He’s also written a number of bestselling books. I got this book after a long-time student and Heroic Coach connected me with Kevin. Apparently my new friend was being interviewed by Kevin about his new book on creativity for a Forbes article. At the end of their chat, my new friend told Kevin that he should check out Heroic. And, apparently, he had JUST signed up for Heroic the day before. (Awesome.) This book, as per the sub-title and intro quote, is all about the top productivity habits of some of the world’s most productive and successful people. It’s written in a straight-forward, conversational style. There’s a reason it has over 1,400 reviews—it’s fantastic. It’s packed with Big Ideas. I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Rick Rubin is an iconic music producer. He’s worked with some of the most successful musicians in the world—from Adele, Tom Petty, and Johnny Cash to the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, and LL Cool J. He’s also the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings and former co-President of Columbia Records. And, he’s a Transcendental Meditation practitioner who writes with the same lucidity as Yuval Noah Harari whose preferred flavor of meditation happens to be Vipassana. This book is the distillation of the wisdom he’s gained working on himself and his craft over the last forty years. It’s PHENOMENAL. I highly recommend it. From the minimalist cover to the short, pithy micro chapters (both of which inspired my book Areté), the book itself is a work of art. It’s packed with profound wisdom on how to create great art and how to make your life your ultimate masterpiece. I’m excited to share some of my favorite Big Ideas so let’s jump straight in.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Dave Asprey is a fascinating guy. He’s a professional bio-hacking machine whose publicly-stated goal is to live to 180. We covered his last book called The Bulletproof Diet and our kitchen’s pantry is filled with a bunch of his Bulletproof products. In this book, he unveils his best bio-hacks for, as the sub-title suggests, “activating untapped brain energy to work smarter and think faster.” Big Ideas we explore: Your brain on energy, kryptonite dust (what’re yours?), mitochondria (one QUADRILLION!), EZ water (how to drop into that spot between a gas and a liquid), and junk light.</div>

Bimodal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eRhythmic.\u003c/strong\u003e This style is all about finding a consistent \u003cem\u003erhythm\u003c/em\u003e of Deep Work. You may not be able to go full-Hermit on it, but you CAN find that hour before everyone gets up or before you go into email or fill-in-the-blank with YOUR favorite time. Find that time. Protect it. Make it rhythmic.
