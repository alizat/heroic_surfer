And \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/nathaniel-branden/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eNathaniel Branden\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCampbell tells us that he doesn’t understand why there’s all this talk about annihilating the ego when, in fact, it’s our egos that keep us in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen Wilber tells us that it’s not “ego-minus” but “ego-plus.” We need a \u003cem\u003estrong\u003c/em\u003e ego that’s plugged into something bigger than ourselves. THAT’s when the magic happens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have Nathaniel Branden who tells us that even if we think “letting go of” the ego is either desirable or possible (he and I don’t think it’s either), successfully letting go of your ego would, by definition, require you to have a firm grip on your ego before you could let it go. (Think about it for a second: How can you let go of something you never had hold of?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which leads me to how I think we should think about our ego.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, there are so many different definitions of what the “ego” is that we can get dizzy trying to keep up. I prefer to think of the ego in a classic Western psychoanalytic frame a la Freud.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn that model we have three components: our “id,” our “superego” and our “ego.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur id is that impulsive part of us that wants everything right.this.second. Doesn’t matter whether it’s good for us or not. Just give it to us. NOW. Say hello to all your addictions—be they digital (“Hi, smartphone!”) or chemical (“Hi sugar and flour and alcohol and…”).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur superego is basically the conditioned part of us that’s constantly judging all those things your id did and wondering what in the world you were thinking. (It also really really really wants people to like us and can lock us into conformity.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have our ego. Our ego is that part of us that keeps our id and superego in check. We NEED a STRONG ego to make sure we don’t spin out of control alternating between a hyper-impulsive/addictive version of ourselves and a hyper-conforming/ashamed version of ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which brings us back to where we started: \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/the-4-disciplines-of-execution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDISCIPLINE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow do you get your ego to be strong enough to deal with the pulls of the id and the superego? You dominate your environment. You cultivate a heightened level of self-awareness to know how to make yourself proud and then you match that self-awareness with an equally high level of self-mastery such that you consciously, joyfully do the right thing moment to moment to moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou know what happens then?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour golden light shines through.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour divine spiritual essence (however you want to define it) finally has a stable home in which to hang out and shine forth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s to your ego.

(lol)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomewhere around the 13th or 14th century, in what is now Thailand, Buddhist monks made an epic, giant, golden Buddha statue. 10 feet tall. Weighing over 5.5 TONS.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, in 1767, Burmese invaders were approaching.

The statue was ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut… The trick worked TOO well.

I place 7th out of those 149 guys which I’m pretty happy about as it puts me one step closer to hitting the target of being a world-class athlete via placing in the Top 10 for my age group in a qualifying event.

For most celebrity actors, only as good as their last movie, the self is under constant evaluation, repeated threat. The same is true for international scientists, only as good as their last paper, their past achievements having set the bar at heights they have to exceed again and again. Or the salesperson, only as good as the last contract landed. After all, people do not compare the director’s new movie, the scientist’s new scientific paper or the businessman’s latest deal with his average achievement. They compare it with the most easily remembered previous movie/paper/deal—which is usually the best one.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd that is the proposed solution to the mystery of the Oscars—winning an Oscar may offer a powerful and near-everlasting ‘safety signal for self’—a sort of lifelong insurance policy that protects ‘me’ against the terrible stress of other people’s negative evaluations. Winning an Oscar may be one lifelong ‘all clear’ air-raid siren—a permanent safety signal that your self is secure. That is perhaps why winning an Oscar makes you live so much longer—by protecting your self, it defends your body.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s from a fascinating chapter called “The Mystery of the Oscars” in which we explore the question: “Why do we want to win?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Note: Each of the core chapters in the book answers a different question—starting with “Are we born to win?” then moving on to “Is winning a matter of chance and circumstances?” then “What does power do to us?” and concluding with “Does winning have a downside?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShort answers are: No. No. A lot.

We must create a system that constantly reminds us who … we are when we are at our best, because life is not going to pick us up when we fall. There will be forks in the road … mountains to climb, and we are only capable of living up to the image we create for ourselves.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: He ALSO tells us that we need to discipline ourselves to BRING OUR BEST when we FEEL THE WORST.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us: \u003cem\u003e“Remember, visualization will never compensate for the work undone. You cannot visualize lies. All the strategies I employ to answer the simple questions and win the mind game are effective because I put in work. It’s a lot more than mind over matter. It takes relentless self-discipline to schedule suffering into your day, every day, but if you do, you’ll find that at the other end of that suffering is a whole other life just waiting for you.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s a good one-two punch for antifragile confidence. Start by showing up and EARNING your own trust by doing what needs to get done whether you feel like it or not. Then, make sure you’ve got your cookie jar of you at your best filled up so you can get fueled by those past successes when you really need it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhil Stutz says basically the exact same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us that we need to have a “highlight reel” of past successes ready at hand that we can put on repeat when we’re feeling self-doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, as we’ve discussed countless times, he tells us that we need to cultivate our emotional stamina. Remember: “The worse I feel, the more committed I am to the protocol.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe and I actually chatted about this Idea in our Coaching session the other day. I read him part of the blurb and asked him what he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe told me he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen said that the \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e challenge is: “How do you have the Oscar without having the Oscar?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe true winner, he says, is not dependent on any outer event or object to feel like a winner.

Then we create a game to put the new you into action by WOOPing your WIG and WINning while creating Antifragile Confidence + Buoyancy (science says = Levity + Gravity) while rocking our affirmations and affirmaction and remembering Other Image 101 as well.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">The Alter Ego Effect. This is one of the most fun and compelling and inspiring books I’ve read in awhile. I REALLY (!!!) enjoyed reading it, had a ton of fun constructing and playing with some potential Alter Egos and highly recommend it. I also really enjoyed how high-performance coach and mental game strategist Todd Herman describes the science behind the power of “secret identities” to transform our lives and I loved the parallels between his perspective and our Big 3 Identities &gt; Virtues &gt; Behaviors model. Big Ideas we explore include Superman + Clark Kent (who's who?), activating your Heroic Self (the science of), motivation and emotion (share a common Latin root), virtues as super powers (more on the science of), and Crossing the Threshold (Today the day?).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I’m a HUGE fan of Phil and Barry's first book, The Tools. Coming Alive is kinda like The Tools Part 2. In this book, we get four new tools to go along with the original five tools. Big Ideas we explore include how to connect to our Life Force, defeat Part X (their name for that part of each of us that gets in the way), build our confidence and learn to see problems as gifts as we live a GREAT life.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Eric Butterworth was a prolific author and Unity minister—one of the great spiritual teachers of the 20th century. We featured another one of his books called Spiritual Economics. That one transformed my consciousness around money/ambition/etc. (I *highly* recommend it.) Butterworth was also Maya Angelou's spiritual teacher. And, Oprah says that this book is one of her all-time favorites. Big Ideas we explore: Where to find the Divine (hint: look within!), the great decision, the true meaning of “meek” (it's not what you think), going the second mile, and how to create a heaven (or hell) right NOW!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book years ago when I first started working with Steve Chandler. At the time, I read and listened to a ton of his stuff. Steve and I worked together one-on-one for a couple years. This is our sixth Note on his books. It was super fun to reread this book and dive back into Steve’s down-to-earth and empowering wisdom. I love his short, to-the-point, funny style. Big Ideas we explore include the difference between being a Victim vs. an Owner (this is the #1 key on "How to Become the Person You've Always Wanted to Be), lifting real weights not the Styrofoam stuff (but only if you want to get strong!), the fact that Yes lives in the land of No, 10 things you'd do if you had no fear (pick one and go!), and campfires (they're a lot like human spirit--ya gotta re-create one every day!).</div>

In this Note, we'll explore some of his many Big Ideas—including how important discipline is and the fact that as we rock it, our discipline turns to blissipline.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jordan Peterson is one of the world's leading intellectuals. He's a Canadian clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Toronto. (Before that, he taught at Harvard.) He’s published over 100 scientific articles and he’s super-popular on YouTube. This book is wonderfully intense and equally thoughtful. Peterson’s integration of everything from evolutionary psychology, politics, religion and morality is astounding. After taking a super-quick look at all 12 Rules, Big Ideas we cover include the importance of mastering the flow or Order + Chaos (and why RULES are so important), Rule #1 (stand up straight, shoulders back! Remember lobsters...), Rule #2 (Treat yourself better! Remember pets...), Rule #6: Clean up your life (remember to start stopping...), and the fact that your Being is in your Becoming (which is connected to Rule #4...).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">My friend Tripp Lanier has been coaching guys for the last 15+ years. He’s the host of The New Man podcast and is a very funny guy. He’s also a very wise guy. If you (or the man in your life) like to laugh deeply while joyfully getting your Optimizing on, I think you’ll enjoy his “Irreverent Guide for Men Who Refuse to Settle.” Note: This book is not for those who don’t enjoy some colorful language. And... It very much IS for those guys who DO. In fact, although I think anyone not easily offended will enjoy the book, I think this is the PERFECT book for the kind of guy who *doesn’t* usually like “self-help.” Tripp is such a funny, self-deprecating (yet wise!) guy that “normal” guys love. Big Ideas explore include: the experiences we're *really* going after (freedom + aliveness + love + peace), gratitude (the #1 practice), you're NOT a big deal (and THAT's a very big deal), find the fun (PLAY!!), and the ultimate game (is spelled L.O.V.E.).</div>

This book rocks and in the Note we'll explore the six pillars of self-esteem—from the practice of living consciously, accepting ourselves and taking responsibility to practicing self-assertiveness, living purposefully and having personal integrity.

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our sixth (!) Note on one of Tom Morris's books. As you know if you’ve been following, Tom Morris is one of my all-time favorite authors and at least tied for first as my favorite living philosopher. In this book, Professor Morris challenges us to reconsider what it means to be a citizen and an “everyday patriot” in the modern world—committed to upholding the virtues of our highest ideals in our everyday lives. I’m excited to explore a handful of my favorite Big Ideas, so let's jump straight in.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our sixth Note on Darrin Donnelly and the final book from his "Sports for the Soul" series. We've featured the entire series. This book features a fourth-string quarterback on the worst college football team in the conference whose life changes the day he meets his new head coach who turns the program around by helping him and his teammates forge unstoppable confidence. It’s awesome. And, as you’d expect, it’s packed with Big Ideas and I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is Mel Robbins’ second book. We featured her first book called The 5 Second Rule which is A W E S O M E! When I saw she had written this one, I was excited to get it. It is also A W E S O M E! If you’re familiar with Mel, you know she’s one of the leading voices in personal development and transformation. She’s changed millions of lives with her books, podcast, and online courses. In fact, Mel coaches more than 60 million people online every month and videos featuring her work have more than a BILLION views, including her TEDx Talk called “How to stop screwing yourself over” which is one of the most popular of all time. One of the reasons she’s so beloved is because she’s so incredibly real. This book features the High 5 Habit for which the book is named AND a dozen other life-changing tools AND at least that many stories about her own (Heroic!) challenges and how she’s used these tools to flip the switch and create a life of deep meaning and joy. The book is packed with Big Ideas and I’m excited to share a handful of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Alan Cohen has become one of my favorite writers and people and this book is great--it’s precisely what the sub-title promises: “A Five-Minute Soul Recharge for Every Day of the Year.” The perfect treat for a lover of more wisdom in less time. In this Note, we’ll learn how important it is to be in integrity as we answer the voice that’s calling and fire our inner critics while promoting our inner fan club. And, for good measure, we’ll drop in some Harry Potter wisdom. Good times.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Stuart Wilde was a leading a figure in the self-help movement. In the 1990’s, he was giving lectures with Louise Hay, Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer. He’s a really funny guy. This book was written in 1996. It features “33 steps” to tapping into the infinite within you. Big Ideas we explore include the physics of spiritual growth (think: states and traits), Step 1 to tapping into your Infinite Self, how to avoid rat DDT in your life, discipline = power (featuring some hair-splitting on ego vis-a-vis id and superego), and your new superpower: serenity.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Tom Morris is one of my favorite modern philosophers.
He has a dual Ph.D. from Yale in both Philosophy and Religious Studies. He also taught at Notre Dame for 15 years before becoming one of the most sought-after practical philosophers. We’ve featured two of his other books in which he brings ancient wisdom to our modern lives: True Success and The Art of Achievement. (He’s also the philosopher behind Philosophy for Dummies and wrote If Aristotle Ran General Motors and If Harry Potter Ran General Electric.) I got this book after he and I had an electric chat about Optimize 2020 and the role of The Modern Hero. It’s a collection of essays written by some of the smartest and wisest academic philosophers out there. Tom edited it with his son, Matt—which makes me think of *another* book we’ve featured on the wisdom of superheroes written by a dynamic father-son duo: Deepak Chopra and his son Gotham who wrote The Seven Spiritual Laws of Superheroes. I loved diving into some of the deeper philosophical questions inherent to our modern superhero tales. If that sounds like fun, I’ll think you’ll enjoy it as well. Of course, the book is packed with Big Ideas so, KABAM! Let’s throw on our spandex tights and capes and jump straight in.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Newsflash: We're in the midst of a narcissism epidemic. Oh, wait, you probably already knew that! In this great book, Twenge and Campbell, two research psychologists, let us know what's up and how to deal with it. In this Note, we'll look at what narcissism is (think: overconfidence, vanity, materialism and entitlement), the five causes of narcissism, and touch on some Big Ideas on how we can deal with it—personally and culturally. Intense and powerful wisdom.</div>

I read a lot, traveled a bit, etc. And, I got into triathlon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI worked with some coaches.

I place 7th out of those 149 guys which I’m pretty happy about as it puts me one step closer to hitting the target of being a world-class athlete via placing in the Top 10 for my age group in a qualifying event.
