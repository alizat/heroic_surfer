Palmer, MD, is a Harvard psychiatrist and researcher working at the interface between metabolism and health. He’s an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and has held leadership roles at Harvard, McClean Hospital and nationally.

Well, Lupin tells us: “With an incantation, which will work only if you are \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/quotes/sonja-lyubomirsky/375067-distracting-ourselves-from-toxic-comparisons-concentrating-on-our-own-internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003econcentrating\u003c/a\u003e, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDementors feed on our happiness. And, if we allow them to, they will suck our very souls out of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSounds a lot like depression, eh? Indeed it does.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFighting dementors requires magic that even many qualified wizards have difficulty with. Alas, so it is with depression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe charm? We must concentrate WITH ALL OUR MIGHT on a single, very happy memory. Yep. That does the trick with depression as well. We know that the mind can’t simultaneously hold both the depressed and happy thoughts. But we must be fierce in our resolve and concentrate WITH ALL OUR MIGHT if we want to win the battle when the dementors glide into our daily lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEating, moving and sleeping well help, too. So does training your ability to focus WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT via a meditation practice. Oh. And deep breathing helps as well — flips the old switch from the fight-or-flight response (which dementors love) to a relaxation response (which they don’t like so much).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack to Harry. The specific incantation we powerfully speak as we focus on that happy memory? “EXPECTO PATRONUM!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich reveals another key facet to fighting the dementors: We must \u003cem\u003eexpect\u003c/em\u003e that our efforts will work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll that leads to a wonderful creature flowing out of your wand and standing between you and the dementor. As Lupin says, it’s different for each of us. For Harry it was a stag. For Hermione it was an otter. What’s yours? (Mine’s a lion. 🦁)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1. Got any dementors gliding around in your life?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFocus WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT on what’s awesome in your life. KNOW that you can protect yourself from them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“EXPECTO PATRONUM!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S. If you have a bad encounter with a dementor, Rowling tells us that the best way to recover is to eat some chocolate. (Hah! Science agrees that chocolate \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e boost our mood but let’s just make sure we limit it to 1 ounce per day and make sure it’s 80%+ dark chocolate. Too much sugar DOES NOT help the cause. 🤓)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.P.S. Remember the epic stag Harry created to fight off the 100+ dementors near the end of \u003cem\u003eThe Prisoner of Azkaban\u003c/em\u003e? Hermione couldn’t believe he could do that. Even HARRY couldn’t believe it. But… Because of Hermione’s handy dandy time turner, Harry had actually ALREADY SEEN himself do it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs he said in disbelief: “I knew I could do it this time, because I’d already done it … Does that make sense?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich reveals yet another scientifically-proven piece of wisdom. Recalling prior success is one of the fastest ways to boost your self-efficacy in the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s add that to the mix. Focus WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT on what’s awesome in your life. KNOW that you can protect yourself from them.

If you are looking for happiness and esteem, you will not find them listed under their own names. You are more likely to find these if you look under goals. In fact, happier and high self-esteem people are the ones who have concrete and challenging goals in their lives. The philosopher Nietzsche came to a similar conclusion many years ago when he wrote: ‘Formula of my happiness: A Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal.\u003c/em\u003e’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Yes.

It has three elements: 1. A vision for a better future (aka a goal); 2. A belief we can create that future (aka agency); 3. A willingness to find multiple pathways to achieve our goal (moving through inevitable obstacles via Plan A, Plan B, Plan Whatever-It-Takes).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne more time, just to be clear: Without a goal, we can have no hope.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/optimize/search?q=goals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWhat are YOUR goals\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRick gives us a bunch of tips to help us construct our optimal goals. Here’s a quick look at a few.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, we need to focus on “Authoring Our Own Decisions.” We need to let go of the “shoulds” and focus on what we *really* want. That leads to a sense of autonomy which all the research says is SUPER important. (Recall that to be authentic means to be the author of your own life.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he tells us to go “Goal Shopping” and walks us through an exercise in which we write down all the goals we’d like to achieve in all areas of our lives across all time frames. Then we identify the ones that *really* fire us up and focus our energy on them. (Our Big 3 framework of Energy + Work + Love is helpful as a categorization method here!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he tells us to “Control Attention Robbers.” In other words, reduce your distractions so you can focus your energy on what’s truly important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he tells us to make sure we’re “Setting Challenging, Yet Doable Goals.” He describes the science of “goal-stretching.” He tells us: “\u003cem\u003eGoals should not be so far beyond your reach that you are unlikely to attain them. Conversely, goals should not be so easy that you are certain to meet them. In fact, research shows that people believe hopeful goals should involve roughly a 50 percent probability of attainment. … Be careful not to set your goals at such an easy level, however, that you become bored or disinterested. Likewise, avoid making goals so difficult that you or anyone else would be unlikely to achieve them. This can be as deflating to hopeful thinking as the setting of exceedingly easy goals.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, finally, he says: “\u003cem\u003eIf you are balking at my suggestion about clearly defining goals, your vague goals may be contributing to a pattern of low-hope thinking. Remember that clear goals at least set the stage for successful goal attainment. Vague goals, on the other hand, typically preclude any such sense of attainment.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoals checklist: What’s on the top of your authentic list?

You may be surprised to find out that an estimated 80 to 90 percent of the amount of serotonin in your body is manufactured by the nerve cells in your gut! In fact, your gut’s brain makes more serotonin—the master happiness molecule—than the brain in your head does. Many neurologists and psychiatrists are now realizing that this may be one reason why antidepressants are often less effective in treating depression than dietary changes are.

He tells us: “\u003cem\u003eSince the time of the ancient philosopher Seneca or before, having a overly high opinion of oneself has been seen as the chief obstacle of feeling and expressing gratitude. Research has shown that people who are ungrateful tend to have a sense of excessive self-importance, arrogance, vanity, and a high need for admiration and approval. At the more pathological end of the scale are narcissists, people who are profoundly self-absorbed and lack the empathy needed for entering deep, satisfying, mutually enhancing interpersonal relationships. At the more ordinary end of things are people who just feel entitled—to good grades, exemption from having to follow the rules, and special treatment of all kinds. The entitlement attitude says, ‘life owes me something’ or ‘people owe me something’ or ‘I deserve this.’ In all its manifestations, a preoccupation with the self can cause us to forget our benefits and our benefactors or to feel that we are owed things from others and therefore have no reason to feel thankful.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s from a chapter in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/gratitude-works-robert-emmons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGratitude Works!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e called “The Biggest Obstacle to Gratitude—and Its Remedy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap: The biggest obstacle to gratitude is a sense of ENTITLEMENT—the belief that the world owes you something. And, because you are entitled to all the awesome things in your life and “deserve” it all, there’s no reason for you to feel grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe remedy to entitlement? HUMILITY.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Robert beautifully tells us: “\u003cem\u003eThe more I contemplate the requirements for cultivating gratitude, the more I am convinced of the necessity of humility. In gratitude and humility we turn to realities outside of ourselves. We become aware of our limitations and our need to rely on others. In gratitude and humility, we acknowledge the myth of self-sufficiency. We look upward and outward to the sources that sustain us. Becoming aware of realities greater than ourselves shields us from the illusion of being self-made, being here on this planet by right—expecting everything and owing nothing. The humble person says that life is a gift to be grateful for, not a right to be claimed. Humility ushers in a grateful response.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne more time: We can take the amazing people and goodness in our lives FOR GRANTED or \u003cstrong\u003eAS GRANTED\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s ALL one big GIFT.

If you try to have the best of everything, you’re likely to be paralyzed by indecision or dissatisfied with your choice. In fact, this kind of ‘maximizing’ has been proven to increase depression.

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is a great book. In Rethinking Depression, Eric Maisel presents an incredibly persuasive case for how medicalized we’ve made the normal human emotions of sadness, anxiety and other unfun feelings (and how dangerous that is) while giving us an existential handbook on how to deal with life’s challenges by creating an authentic life packed with meaning. In this Note, we check out the fact that unhappiness happens while learning how to create our “existential ideal” as we make meaning in our lives! (And, therefore, a *lot* more happiness.)</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Alex Korb is a neuroscientist in the department of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles. (Go Bruins!) He’s also a great writer. As per the sub-title, the book is all about “Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression, One Small Change at a Time.” It’s REALLY good. Inspiring. Scientifically grounded. Simple. Practical. ← A winning formula for a great book! Big Ideas we explore include the power of exercising your brain (which is the #1 tip, btw), setting goals (and making decisions), developing positive habits (via repetition, repetition, repetition), biofeedback (and how to take advantage of it), and the power of others (rely on it!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I’m a big fan of Kelly McGonigal and her ability to help us apply scientific wisdom to our lives. We’ve covered two of her earlier books: The Willpower Instinct and The Upside of Stress. So... When I got this book, knew I’d enjoy it. But, I didn’t anticipate JUST how much I’d love it. We have some great Notes on Movement (Spark, Spartan Up and No Sweat among my favorites), but Kelly’s book will be our new go-to for the science of WHY exercise/movement is so essential to our well-being. It’s PHENOMENAL. Reading about the SCIENCE behind stories of transformation (and how, as per the sub-title of her book: “Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage”) also made me that much more clear on the power of what we’re doing with all of our work and the importance of focusing so much on Energy (especially with our Mastery and Coach programs). Big Ideas we explore include: Hope Molecules (and how to create them), persistence highs (and how to create them), collective effervescence (and why it's so awesome), how we endure (hint: TOGETHER!), and OMMS!!! (Obstacles (literally!) Make Me Stronger!).</div>

It's actually a *textbook* not a normal book.

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is a VERY important book that has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach mental health care. For years, we have talked about the importance of getting our ENERGY optimized so we can show up powerfully in our Work and in our Love. We’ve also discussed the fact that our PHYSIOLOGY drives a *LOT* more of our PSYCHOLOGY than most of us think. This book provides the underlying theoretical framework that ties all that wisdom together. Christopher M. Palmer, MD, is a Harvard psychiatrist and researcher working at the interface between metabolism and health. He’s an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and has held leadership roles at Harvard, McClean Hospital and nationally. In this thoughtful, scientifically-grounded book, Palmer shares his “theory of brain energy” that, in short, establishes the fact that “mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain.” THAT, my Heroic friend, is a VERY (!!!) Big Idea. Let's jump in and discuss why this theoretical framework matters AND discuss some practical Ideas on how we can apply the wisdom to our lives TODAY.</div>

<p class="!pb-0">by<!-- --> <span><a class="font-normal text-red transition-colors hover:text-red-700" href="/authors/matthew-walker-phd">Matthew Walker PhD</a></span></p>
<div class="line-clamp-2">Matthew Walker is one of the world’s leading neuroscientists and sleep experts. He’s a professor at UC Berkeley (and former professor at Harvard) who has spent decades studying why we sleep and how to, as per the sub-title of this book, unlock the power of sleep and dreams. As you know if you’ve been following along, I’m a HUGE advocate of Optimizing our sleep as a fundamental practice in Optimizing our lives. This book has made me EVEN MORE bullish about the power of sleep. The consequences of chronically depriving ourselves of the sleep we need? Well, they’re astonishingly devastating—dramatically increasing the odds of having everything from mood disorders to cancer (and everything else we don’t want). Big Ideas we explore include the fact that you're more likely to get struck by lightning than have the gene that let's you get by on less than the recommended sleep, the universality of sleep (even worms sleep!!), resetting baselines, the iPad effect (did you know how much using one before sleep messes w/your melatonin?), and some tips to Optimize your sleep TONIGHT!!!</div>

a big fan of Kelly McGonigal and her ability to help us apply scientific wisdom to our lives. We’ve covered two of her earlier books: The Willpower Instinct and The Upside of Stress. So... When I got this book, knew I’d enjoy it. But, I didn’t anticipate JUST how much I’d love it. We have some great Notes on Movement (Spark, Spartan Up and No Sweat among my favorites), but Kelly’s book will be our new go-to for the science of WHY exercise/movement is so essential to our well-being. It’s PHENOMENAL. Reading about the SCIENCE behind stories of transformation (and how, as per the sub-title of her book: “Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage”) also made me that much more clear on the power of what we’re doing with all of our work and the importance of focusing so much on Energy (especially with our Mastery and Coach programs). Big Ideas we explore include: Hope Molecules (and how to create them), persistence highs (and how to create them), collective effervescence (and why it's so awesome), how we endure (hint: TOGETHER!), and OMMS!!! (Obstacles (literally!) Make Me Stronger!).3b:T45f,This is a VERY important book that has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach mental health care. For years, we have talked about the importance of getting our ENERGY optimized so we can show up powerfully in our Work and in our Love. We’ve also discussed the fact that our PHYSIOLOGY drives a *LOT* more of our PSYCHOLOGY than most of us think. This book provides the underlying theoretical framework that ties all that wisdom together. Christopher M. Palmer, MD, is a Harvard psychiatrist and researcher working at the interface between metabolism and health. He’s an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and has held leadership roles at Harvard, McClean Hospital and nationally. In this thoughtful, scientifically-grounded book, Palmer shares his “theory of brain energy” that, in short, establishes the fact that “mental disorders are metaboli"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c disorders of the brain.” THAT, my Heroic friend, is a VERY (!!!) Big Idea. Let's jump in and discuss why this theoretical framework matters AND discuss some practical Ideas on how we can apply the wisdom to our lives TODAY.3c:T44c,Matthew Walker is one of the world’s leading neuroscientists and sleep experts. He’s a professor at UC Berkeley (and former professor at Harvard) who has spent decades studying why we sleep and how to, as per the sub-title of this book, unlock the power of sleep and dreams. As you know if you’ve been following along, I’m a HUGE advocate of Optimizing our sleep as a fundamental practice in Optimizing our lives. This book has made me EVEN MORE bullish about the power of sleep. The consequences of chronically depriving ourselves of the sleep we need? Well, they’re astonishingly devastating—dramatically increasing the odds of having everything from mood disorders to cancer (and everything else we don’t want). Big Ideas we explore include the fact that you're more likely to get struck by lightning than have the gene that let's you get by on less than the recommended sleep, the universality of sleep (even worms sleep!!), resetting baselines, the iPad effect (did you know how much using one before sleep messes w/your melatonin?), and some tips to Optimize your sleep TONIGHT!!!3d:T692,\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/gratitude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eIn our last +1\u003c/a\u003e, we chatted about the scientifically-proven power of gratitude: Simply writing down 5 things you’re grateful for can boost your happiness up to 25%.

If you are looking for happiness and esteem, you will not find them listed under their own names. You are more likely to find these if you look under goals. In fact, happier and high self-esteem people are the ones who have concrete and challenging goals in their lives. The philosopher Nietzsche came to a similar conclusion many years ago when he wrote: ‘Formula of my happiness: A Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal.\u003c/em\u003e’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Yes.

It has three elements: 1. A vision for a better future (aka a goal); 2. A belief we can create that future (aka agency); 3. A willingness to find multiple pathways to achieve our goal (moving through inevitable obstacles via Plan A, Plan B, Plan Whatever-It-Takes).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne more time, just to be clear: Without a goal, we can have no hope.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/optimize/search?q=goals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWhat are YOUR goals\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRick gives us a bunch of tips to help us construct our optimal goals. Here’s a quick look at a few.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, we need to focus on “Authoring Our Own Decisions.” We need to let go of the “shoulds” and focus on what we *really* want. That leads to a sense of autonomy which all the research says is SUPER important. (Recall that to be authentic means to be the author of your own life.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he tells us to go “Goal Shopping” and walks us through an exercise in which we write down all the goals we’d like to achieve in all areas of our lives across all time frames. Then we identify the ones that *really* fire us up and focus our energy on them. (Our Big 3 framework of Energy + Work + Love is helpful as a categorization method here!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he tells us to “Control Attention Robbers.” In other words, reduce your distractions so you can focus your energy on what’s truly important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he tells us to make sure we’re “Setting Challenging, Yet Doable Goals.” He describes the science of “goal-stretching.” He tells us: “\u003cem\u003eGoals should not be so far beyond your reach that you are unlikely to attain them. Conversely, goals should not be so easy that you are certain to meet them. In fact, research shows that people believe hopeful goals should involve roughly a 50 percent probability of attainment. … Be careful not to set your goals at such an easy level, however, that you become bored or disinterested. Likewise, avoid making goals so difficult that you or anyone else would be unlikely to achieve them. This can be as deflating to hopeful thinking as the setting of exceedingly easy goals.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, finally, he says: “\u003cem\u003eIf you are balking at my suggestion about clearly defining goals, your vague goals may be contributing to a pattern of low-hope thinking. Remember that clear goals at least set the stage for successful goal attainment. Vague goals, on the other hand, typically preclude any such sense of attainment.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoals checklist: What’s on the top of your authentic list?

In fact, your gut’s brain makes more serotonin—the master happiness molecule—than the brain in your head does. Many neurologists and psychiatrists are now realizing that this may be one reason why antidepressants are often less effective in treating depression than dietary changes are.

He tells us: “\u003cem\u003eSince the time of the ancient philosopher Seneca or before, having a overly high opinion of oneself has been seen as the chief obstacle of feeling and expressing gratitude. Research has shown that people who are ungrateful tend to have a sense of excessive self-importance, arrogance, vanity, and a high need for admiration and approval. At the more pathological end of the scale are narcissists, people who are profoundly self-absorbed and lack the empathy needed for entering deep, satisfying, mutually enhancing interpersonal relationships. At the more ordinary end of things are people who just feel entitled—to good grades, exemption from having to follow the rules, and special treatment of all kinds. The entitlement attitude says, ‘life owes me something’ or ‘people owe me something’ or ‘I deserve this.’ In all its manifestations, a preoccupation with the self can cause us to forget our benefits and our benefactors or to feel that we are owed things from others and therefore have no reason to feel thankful.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s from a chapter in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/gratitude-works-robert-emmons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGratitude Works!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e called “The Biggest Obstacle to Gratitude—and Its Remedy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap: The biggest obstacle to gratitude is a sense of ENTITLEMENT—the belief that the world owes you something. And, because you are entitled to all the awesome things in your life and “deserve” it all, there’s no reason for you to feel grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe remedy to entitlement? HUMILITY.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Robert beautifully tells us: “\u003cem\u003eThe more I contemplate the requirements for cultivating gratitude, the more I am convinced of the necessity of humility. In gratitude and humility we turn to realities outside of ourselves. We become aware of our limitations and our need to rely on others. In gratitude and humility, we acknowledge the myth of self-sufficiency. We look upward and outward to the sources that sustain us. Becoming aware of realities greater than ourselves shields us from the illusion of being self-made, being here on this planet by right—expecting everything and owing nothing. The humble person says that life is a gift to be grateful for, not a right to be claimed. Humility ushers in a grateful response.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne more time: We can take the amazing people and goodness in our lives FOR GRANTED or \u003cstrong\u003eAS GRANTED\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s ALL one big GIFT.
