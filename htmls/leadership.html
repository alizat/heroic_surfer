This book is, as per the back cover, “a clear-eyed account of learning to lead in a chaotic world” in which Mattis “recounts the foundational experiences and lessons he learned over four decades and in three wars. It is a journey about learning to lead at every level, with insights equally applicable to the military, to business, and to individual growth.” I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a long-time student (and Heroic Coach) who also happens to be a commanding officer in the U.S. military. It’s an absolutely FANTASTIC memoir packed with wisdom on how to lead—which is why it has nearly 5,000 5-star reviews. The book reminds me of two other memoirs by military leaders I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories and General Colin Powell’s It Worked for Me.

McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history’s most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there’s a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the “myths” of leadership and the MUCH MESSIER “realities” of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership. We end the book with the sober recognition of just how complex, dynamic and context-specific good leadership is. It’s a challenging, important book that’s difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I’m excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership.

The book is, as you’d expect from the title, all about helping us learn how to lead to win. It’s part memoir, part leadership manual—featuring 33 powerful stories from Admiral Manazir’s life and the lessons he gained along the way. It reminds me of another memoir by another Navy Admiral I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories. In fact, as I type that, I realize that this book is kinda like a hybrid of McRaven’s memoir AND his latest book called The Hero Code. Mash those two books up and swap out the SEAL stories for a Top Gun Fighter Pilot’s and voilà—you get this book. As you’d expect, the book is PACKED with Big Ideas. I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!","title":"Learn How to Lead to Win","pnSubtitle":"33 Powerful Stories and Leadership Lessons","slug":"learn-how-to-lead-to-win","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","authorDetails":[{"__typename":"Author","id":"3677405","slug":"mike-manazir","authorName":"Mike Manazir","imageUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/mike-manazir.jpg","tagline":"Retired Two-Star Rear Admiral with the US Navy and former Top Gun fighter turned business executive with a Fortune 100 aerospace and defense company.","contentType":"AUTHOR"}],"coverImage":"https://assets.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/book-covers/learn-how-to-lead-to-win-cover.png","contentType":"PHILOSOPHERNOTE","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PhilosopherNote","id":"31428","intro":"Robin Sharma is one of the world’s top leadership experts.

To bring the point home, they tell us a story about guys in boats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImagine Navy SEAL training. You’re already exhausted from weeks of basic training. Now it’s time for Hell Week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most brutal aspects of the training is when the aspiring SEALs are split into “boat crews”—each with seven guys. Each team gets an old-school World War II-era inflatable boat that weighs 200 pounds. They need to carry this boat up and over 20-foot-high sand berms and run with it for miles. Then they get to paddle it out to the ocean, dump it over so everyone’s out and freezing wet and then paddle it back in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’re always competing with everyone else. If you lose, you have to go through extra, bonus brutal stuff while the winners get to take the next race off. (The instructors constantly remind everyone: “It pays to be a winner!”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, with that in mind, imagine Boat Crew II. These guys win every single race. They’re simply crushing it. And, although they’re physically hammered, they’re actually smiling throughout the process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have Boat Crew VI. These guys are LOSING every single race. To put it mildly, they are simply NOT crushing it. And, as you can imagine, they’re not too happy about it—cursing and blaming one another for all their problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach crew has a leader. Boat Crew VI’s leader is convinced that they’re losing because his team sucks. He’s certain that Boat Crew II is simply made up of the best guys and his team isn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, our wise instructor knows that there’s no such thing as a bad team, just a bad leader.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, he devises a little experiment. He commands the leaders to swap teams. The leader from the always-winning Boat Crew II would now switch places with the leader from the always-losing Boat Crew VI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat happens?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, the worst boat crew suddenly became the best.

PRESENCE. In fact, Stanford’s Emma Seppälä tells us: “Charisma, simply put, is absolute presence.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAbsolute presence\u003c/em\u003e.

Don’t be the person constantly checking your phone for the latest push notification. You know what that tells the person you’re with? That you just don’t care that much about them. And, that’s a great way to kill all connection and charisma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Another pro tip: Make eye contact.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur second facet of charisma? Power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresence is the first step, but, according to Cabane, it’s not enough by itself. People are constantly, subconsciously detecting power or a lack thereof. Therefore, if we want to dial up our charisma, we need to dial up our personal power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEasiest way to do that? Your body language. Stand tall, breathe deeply, smile. And, while you’re at it, another great, quick way to boost your power before an interaction is to recall a prior success. Visualize it. FEEL the power you had when you crushed it. Soak THAT in, smile and go connect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third facet of charisma? Warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe may be present and powerful but if the person with whom we’re interacting doesn’t think we’ll use that power for their good then… no charisma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… Dial up your presence and your power AND your warmth.

We want to shift to The Empowerment Dynamic. Here’s the quick look at this super simple and equally powerful framework to Optimize our interpersonal dynamics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, draw a triangle with a point at the top. Then draw a second triangle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn your first triangle, put “Victim” at the very top. Then put “Rescuer” on the bottom left and “Persecutor” on the bottom right. That’s your Dreaded Drama Triangle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn your second triangle, put “Creator” at the very top. Then put “Coach” on the bottom left and “Challenger” on the bottom right.” That’s your Empowerment Dynamic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s start on the top of that first triangle. In our Dreaded Drama Triangle, we start with a Victim orientation. When we’re showing up as a Victim, we’re focused on what’s wrong and we tend to feel Persecuted by life and we look for things or people to Rescue us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, let’s say we lose our job. The Victim will complain about how their former employer or the economy or the world at large is constantly Persecuting them. They might look for someone to Rescue them from all their problems and/or turn to a substance that will numb them and temporarily Rescue them from those problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd… When we play in DDT, we tend to bounce around and play other roles in that triangle. When we’re not playing the role of the Victim, we might step into the role of angry Persecutor or enabling Rescuer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, in our Empowerment Dynamic, we start with a Creator orientation.

Every human being has a perfect right to say either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and this does not bother an owner. An owner honors that right. Therefore, when owners hear ‘no,’ they don’t think something is wrong with the universe. They don’t conclude that life is unfair. They move right on to their next request. Life is requests and promises.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVictims spend the better part of their lives trying to avoid hearing the word ‘no,’ because they’ve made it mean rejection—total, thorough, and personal—rejection. It is little wonder they want to avoid it whenever possible. The trouble is that by avoiding ‘no,’ they also avoid ‘yes.’ The two go together. They live together.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe primary reason that people don’t get what they want in life is that they are afraid to ask for it.

In this class, we’ll explore the fact that leadership starts by leading yourself as we identify your noble purpose, chisel your foundation, create a compelling vision, embrace the process, and do what you’re here to do.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Mike Erwin joins us as a guest teacher for this class! CEO of The Character Center, co-founder of the Positivity Project, and co-author of the book Lead Yourself First, Mike is passionate about inspiring leaders across the country. His secret sauce to leadership? Solitude! (More specifically, freedom from the input of other minds.) In this class, Mike debunks the assumption that great leaders must always be accessible and uncovers the personal + organizational benefits of leaders who seek out periods of solitude.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Doris Kearns Goodwin has been studying presidential history and leadership for five decades since she first became a professor at Harvard. She has won a Pulitzer Prize and her bestseller Team of Rivals was the basis for Steven Spielberg’s Academy Award–winning film Lincoln. In this book, she walks us through four case studies in leadership: Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson. If you enjoy studying leadership like I do, I think you’ll love this book as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include the one quality all of our very different leaders possessed (hint: FIERCE AMBITION), Lincoln's commitment to growth ("I must die or be better"), the importance of a growth mindset, acquiring virtue Teddy Roosevelt style and the importance of finding ways to relieve stress.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Solitude. It’s the secret sauce to leadership. But... In their great book Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin tells us: “Solitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction. Like a great wave that saturates everything in its path, however, handheld devices and other media now leave us awash with the thoughts of others. We are losing solitude without even realizing it.” Big Ideas we explore include the big 4 of solitude (clarity + creativity + emotional balance + moral courage), the threats from our "Input Age," how MLK and Eisenhower used solitude, FOMO (get over it!) and how to change the world (starting with YOU!).</div>

He’s trained millions (literally) of leaders and has written over 50 (!) books that have sold over 13 million copies—this one alone has sold over 3 million copies. After a super quick look at the 21 Laws, Big Ideas we explore: The Law of Process (aka: Leaders are learners), the foundation of leadership (= trust), leaders are practical AND visionary, the law of victory (!), and your legacy—what will people say when you die? + What’s your “life sentence”?</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fourth Note on one of Admiral McRaven’s great books. As we discussed in the previous Notes, as a four-star admiral, McRaven’s final assignment was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces. He served as a Navy SEAL for 37 years. By the time he hit 34 years of service, he was officially anointed as the “Bull Frog”—the longest serving frogman and Navy SEAL on active duty. This book, as per the title, is wisdom from this legendary bullfrog. McRaven distills leadership into its most fundamental components, delivering on the subtitle: “Leadership Made Simple (But Not Easy).” As you’d expect, it’s PACKED with practical wisdom.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">General Jim Mattis is the former Secretary of Defense and one of the most formidable strategic thinkers of the twenty-first century. He wrote this book with Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine. This book is, as per the back cover, “a clear-eyed account of learning to lead in a chaotic world” in which Mattis “recounts the foundational experiences and lessons he learned over four decades and in three wars. It is a journey about learning to lead at every level, with insights equally applicable to the military, to business, and to individual growth.” I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a long-time student (and Heroic Coach) who also happens to be a commanding officer in the U.S. military. It’s an absolutely FANTASTIC memoir packed with wisdom on how to lead—which is why it has nearly 5,000 5-star reviews. The book reminds me of two other memoirs by military leaders I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories and General Colin Powell’s It Worked for Me. It also reminds me of Phil Knight’s memoir Shoe Dog and Ray Dalio’s Principles. And... For related books on leadership, check out our Notes on General Stanley McChrystal’s Leaders: Myths and Reality plus Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Leadership in Turbulent Times. As you’d expect, this book is packed with Big Ideas. I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book after I saw General Stanley McChrystal’s blurb on the back of Ryan Holiday’s Lives of the Stoics. I read it in one 8.8-hour Deep Work-filled day. It’s fantastic. McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history’s most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there’s a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the “myths” of leadership and the MUCH MESSIER “realities” of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership. We end the book with the sober recognition of just how complex, dynamic and context-specific good leadership is. It’s a challenging, important book that’s difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I’m excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership. So... Let’s get to work!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Admiral William H. McRaven is a Retired U.S. Navy SEAL who served for thirty-seven years and commanded at every level. As a Four-Star Admiral, his final assignment was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces. (During this time, he oversaw the covert mission that killed Osama bin Laden.) In 2014, he gave the commencement address to the graduates of the University of Texas at Austin. Millions of people wound up watching his speech on ten lessons he learned from his Navy SEAL training. This book takes a deeper look at those ten lessons. It’s a super-quick read—packed with simple, yet profound wisdom along with moving stories of moral exemplars. It's FANTASTIC.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Peter Drucker is considered the father of modern management. This book was originally published in 1967. It’s *remarkably* well written and lucid. And, of course, packed with Big Ideas on how to optimize our effectiveness. We cover the 5 key practices/habits of the effective executive: time (first things first; second things never!), contribution (what can you contribute?), strengths (make yours productive; make weaknesses irrelevant), concentration (the secret to effectiveness), decisions (boundary conditions help).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Ray Dalio is one of the most successful people alive. In fact, Time magazine says that he’s one of the 100 most influential people on the planet while Fortune magazine tells us his company (Bridgewater Associates) is the 5th most impactful private company in the U.S. and Forbes tells us that he’s one of the 100 wealthiest people on the planet. All of which makes Dalio, to use his words, “believable” when it comes to discussing how to get what we want in life and work. Enter: Principles. Big Ideas we explore: how to evolve, what’s most important, meet the shapers, Principles #1 (Embrace reality and deal with it) + #2 (5-Step process to getting what you want in life), and the two AI’s: Artificial Intelligence + Ancient Intelligence.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book immediately after finishing Admiral McRaven’s first book, Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life... And Maybe the World. That one’s a quick-reading little book on the ten lessons McRaven learned in his SEAL training that we can all apply to our modern lives. It was fantastic. I had a strong feeling this memoir on his “Life in Special Operations” would be just as good. It is. As per the back cover, “Admiral William H. McRaven is a part of American military history, having been involved in some of the most famous missions in recent memory, including the capture of Saddam Hussein, the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, and the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.” McRaven is a brilliant story teller with, as you can imagine, an incredible array of stories to tell. But that’s not why I loved this book so much. I loved it because reading it made me want to be a better human being. If you enjoy autobiographies and appreciate the military heroes who serve our country as much as I do, I think you’ll love the book as much as I did.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Mike Manazir (“Muh-naw-zur”) is a Retired US Navy Admiral and Top Gun Fighter Pilot. I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a Commanding Officer in the US military (and a Heroic Coach). My friend recommended Jim Mattis’s book on leadership (Call Sign Chaos) and that book was so good that I asked him what *other* books on leadership he’d recommend. He immediately told me about this one. I immediately got it. Manazir was one of his cherished mentors. After reading this great book, I can see why. The book is, as you’d expect from the title, all about helping us learn how to lead to win. It’s part memoir, part leadership manual—featuring 33 powerful stories from Admiral Manazir’s life and the lessons he gained along the way. It reminds me of another memoir by another Navy Admiral I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories. In fact, as I type that, I realize that this book is kinda like a hybrid of McRaven’s memoir AND his latest book called The Hero Code. Mash those two books up and swap out the SEAL stories for a Top Gun Fighter Pilot’s and voilà—you get this book. As you’d expect, the book is PACKED with Big Ideas. I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Colin Powell is a retired four-star general in the United States Army and has earned numerous military, civilian, and foreign honors. He served four presidential administrations in a variety of roles, most recently as Secretary of State from 2001 to 2005. In this great book, he shares the wisdom he gained that, as per the title, worked for him in life and leadership. It's fantastic. Big Ideas we explore include a super-quick look at his Thirteen Rules, the power of perpetual optimism (it's a force multiplier!), starting with "It can be done" (but making sure we're optimists and not stupid :), entering the Zone of Calm (essential for a leader), the fact that good leaders know that good plans are revised immediately, and how to deal with fear and failure.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the classic text on the psychology of persuasion. Robert Cialdini is a professor of both psychology and marketing at Arizona State University. He’s one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of persuasion. The book is simultaneously kind of a consumer protection guide (how not to be duped) AND a manual for marketers (how to sell your stuff!). Cialdini has identified six core psychological principles of persuasion. We take a quick look at each, how they can be used for good or ill and how to apply the wisdom to our lives today.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I just love his no-nonsense, straight-to-the-point approach. His words pack a wise punch. We already profiled another one of his great books, The Total Money Makeover, and I’m excited to have some fun taking a quick peek at a few of my favorite Big Ideas from this equally great book: EntreLeadership, where he shares his best “practical business wisdom” he’s learned “from the trenches.” Big Ideas include understanding that you are the problem (and the solution!), the importance of passion and vision, and how it takes about fifteen years to be an overnight success.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Welcome to Harry Potter #4. It’s time for the Quidditch World Cup, the Goblet of Fire, and the Triwizard Tournament. And... Voldemort’s back. Emerson and I had fun hammering through this 752-page tome a little every night. Even just picking up the book and asking him how we’d get through it was a lesson in breaking down big goals into bite-sized small wins! Big Ideas we explore include: The commitment with which you need to enter your name into the Goblet of Fire, two quick tips on how to win a battle with a dragon, how to deal with critics, the magic of the Pensieve (and the fact you already have a magic wand), embracing our complexity Dumbledore style and the power of courageously confronting reality.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book after reading Dan Pink's To Sell Is Human. As he says in the front-cover testimonial: "The rare book that is both practical and profound." If you'd like to, as the sub-title suggests, get anyone (including yourself!!) to do anything (fast!), then I think you'll enjoy the book. Big Ideas we cover include: the 3 guiding principles and the 5-steps of the Instant Influence process, the law of psychological reactance (and how to avoid it! hint: focus on autonomy!), and creating an action plan plus a personal contract to rock it.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our 4th Note on one of John Maxwell’s books. We also have Notes on The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth, and How Successful People Think. John is one of my absolute favorite writers and teachers. His books are *ridiculously* packed with Big Ideas. (Like, jumbo-ridiculously packed with practical wisdom.) As we’ve discussed, he’s one of the world’s leading authorities on leadership. He’s sold over 25 million copies of his dozens of books that have been translated into over 50 languages. His organizations have also trained leaders in EVERY single country around the world. This is his most recent book, written after FIFTY (!) years of leadership. As per the sub-title, John walks us through the “11 Essential Changes” he has made and that he encourages every leader to embrace. Big Ideas we explore include a quick look at the 11 essential leadershifts, layered learning (compound those +1s!), consistency (how to pay the price of leadership), moral authority (the highest form of leadership!), and the Clock + the Compass (how to fulfill your destiny TODAY).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Michael Gelb is one of the world’s leading creativity teachers. He’s also a qi gong and aikido master who wrote one of my favorite books: “How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci.” In this book, he teaches us the art of creating connection. Big Ideas we explore include how to optimize our ability to connect (practice with the little moments!), The Pygmalion Effect (aka the self-fulfilling prophecy), the importance of centering for conflict resolution, and how our addiction to digital devices (ADD) is leading to attention deficit disorder (ADD) which is leading to troubles in connecting and what to do about it.</div>

Jim Mattis is the former Secretary of Defense and one of the most formidable strategic thinkers of the twenty-first century. He wrote this book with Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine. This book is, as per the back cover, “a clear-eyed account of learning to lead in a chaotic world” in which Mattis “recounts the foundational experiences and lessons he learned over four decades and in three wars. It is a journey about learning to lead at every level, with insights equally applicable to the military, to business, and to individual growth.” I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a long-time student (and Heroic Coach) who also happens to be a commanding officer in the U.S. military. It’s an absolutely FANTASTIC memoir packed with wisdom on how to lead—which is why it has nearly 5,000 5-star reviews. The book reminds me of two other memoirs by military leaders I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories and General Colin Powell’s It Worked for Me. It also reminds me of Phil Knight’s memoir Shoe Dog and Ray Dalio’s Principles. And... For related books on leadership, check out our Notes on General Stanley McChrystal’s Leaders: Myths and Reality plus Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Leadership in Turbulent Times. As you’d expect, this book is packed with Big Ideas. I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s jump straight in!3b:T498,I got this book after I saw General Stanley McChrystal’s blurb on the back of Ryan Holiday’s Lives of the Stoics. I read it in one 8.8-hour Deep Work-filled day. It’s fantastic. McChrystal uses Plutarch and his profiles of some of history’s most prominent figures as his inspiration and focuses on thirteen leaders in six pairs plus one standing alone. Almost all leadership books are prescriptive in nature. This book is not. Rather than make us believe that there’s a nice, simple recipe for leadership, McChrystal, Eggers and Mangone present us with the “myths” of"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," leadership and the MUCH MESSIER “realities” of leadership. After the profiles of the thirteen leaders, the authors present the three myths of leadership and their new definition of leadership. We end the book with the sober recognition of just how complex, dynamic and context-specific good leadership is. It’s a challenging, important book that’s difficult to distill into a nice and tidy and practical 6-page Note but I’m excited to share some of my favorite Ideas as we all continue to step up into our own idiosyncratic expressions of Heroic leadership. So... Let’s get to work!3c:T438,I got this book immediately after finishing Admiral McRaven’s first book, Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life... And Maybe the World. That one’s a quick-reading little book on the ten lessons McRaven learned in his SEAL training that we can all apply to our modern lives. It was fantastic. I had a strong feeling this memoir on his “Life in Special Operations” would be just as good. It is. As per the back cover, “Admiral William H. McRaven is a part of American military history, having been involved in some of the most famous missions in recent memory, including the capture of Saddam Hussein, the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, and the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.” McRaven is a brilliant story teller with, as you can imagine, an incredible array of stories to tell. But that’s not why I loved this book so much. I loved it because reading it made me want to be a better human being. If you enjoy autobiographies and appreciate the military heroes who serve our country as much as I do, I think you’ll love the book as much as I did.3d:T4fa,Mike Manazir (“Muh-naw-zur”) is a Retired US Navy Admiral and Top Gun Fighter Pilot. I got this book on the recommendation of a new, dear friend who happens to be a Commanding Officer in the US military (and a Heroic Coach). My friend recommended Jim Mattis’s book on leadership (Call Sign Chaos) and that book was so good that I asked him what *other"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"* books on leadership he’d recommend. He immediately told me about this one. I immediately got it. Manazir was one of his cherished mentors. After reading this great book, I can see why. The book is, as you’d expect from the title, all about helping us learn how to lead to win. It’s part memoir, part leadership manual—featuring 33 powerful stories from Admiral Manazir’s life and the lessons he gained along the way. It reminds me of another memoir by another Navy Admiral I admire: Admiral William McRaven’s Sea Stories. In fact, as I type that, I realize that this book is kinda like a hybrid of McRaven’s memoir AND his latest book called The Hero Code. Mash those two books up and swap out the SEAL stories for a Top Gun Fighter Pilot’s and voilà—you get this book. As you’d expect, the book is PACKED with Big Ideas.

Power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresence is the first step, but, according to Cabane, it’s not enough by itself. People are constantly, subconsciously detecting power or a lack thereof. Therefore, if we want to dial up our charisma, we need to dial up our personal power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEasiest way to do that? Your body language. Stand tall, breathe deeply, smile.

Then draw a second triangle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn your first triangle, put “Victim” at the very top. Then put “Rescuer” on the bottom left and “Persecutor” on the bottom right.

In our Dreaded Drama Triangle, we start with a Victim orientation.

The Victim will complain about how their former employer or the economy or the world at large is constantly Persecuting them. They might look for someone to Rescue them from all their problems and/or turn to a substance that will numb them and temporarily Rescue them from those problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd… When we play in DDT, we tend to bounce around and play other roles in that triangle. When we’re not playing the role of the Victim, we might step into the role of angry Persecutor or enabling Rescuer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, in our Empowerment Dynamic, we start with a Creator orientation. When we live from this perspective we aren’t whiney Victims. We’re empowered Creators. Therefore, we’re not “Persecuted” by life. We’re Challenged by it.

That’s why owners do so well in sales and courtship.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVictims fear the word no and will do amazing things to avoid ever hearing it. To a victim, ‘no’ means rejection. Total, devastating rejection. ‘No’ doesn’t just sound like ‘no’ to the victim, it sounds like, ‘No, no, NO, you are NOT WORTH ANYTHING!’\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut to an owner, ‘no’ is simply the other side of ‘yes.’ ‘No’ and ‘yes’ live together. Every human being has a perfect right to say either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and this does not bother an owner. An owner honors that right. Therefore, when owners hear ‘no,’ they don’t think something is wrong with the universe. They don’t conclude that life is unfair. They move right on to their next request. Life is requests and promises.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVictims spend the better part of their lives trying to avoid hearing the word ‘no,’ because they’ve made it mean rejection—total, thorough, and personal—rejection. It is little wonder they want to avoid it whenever possible. The trouble is that by avoiding ‘no,’ they also avoid ‘yes.’ The two go together. They live together.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe primary reason that people don’t get what they want in life is that they are afraid to ask for it.

The weird thing is if you put two Belgian horses in the harness who are strangers to each other, together they can pull twenty to twenty-four thousand pounds. Two can pull not twice as much as one but three times as much as one. This example represents the power of synergy. However, if the two horses are raised and trained together they learn to pull and think as one. The trained, and therefore unified, pair can pull not only twenty-four thousand pounds but will hit thirty to thirty-two thousand pounds.
