This book is a fun look at Maffetone’s perspective on how to go about breaking the elusive 2-hour marathon.

I loved it as another way to drill Maffetone’s core ideas into my mind and training methodology. It’s basically a holistic look at all the marginal gains we can apply to reach our running potential. Big Ideas we cover include a quick look at just how fast a 1:59 pace is (sub-4:35 min mile for 26.2 miles = CRAZY fast!), the importance of the MIND in hitting the target, why AEROBIC speed is so important (plus, what it is and how to train it), the ideal training schedule (is super dynamic and personal), how to run properly (hot coal technique!), and balancing the catabolic + anabolic phases of training.","title":"1:59","pnSubtitle":"The Sub-Two-Hour Marathon Is Within Reach―Here's How It Will Go Down, and What It Can Teach All Runners about Training and Racing","slug":"159-philip-maffetone","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","authorDetails":[{"__typename":"Author","id":"2980","slug":"dr-philip-maffetone","authorName":"Dr. Philip Maffetone","imageUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/dr-philip-maffetone.jpg","tagline":"Author, researcher, clinician.

He’s an Olympic Gold Medalist and World Champion rifle shooter. He won a silver medal after having what he calls a “mental meltdown” in the 1972 Olympics. Then he spent several hours a day for the next couple years talking to every gold medalist he could find about how they were THINKING while they were performing at such an elite level. In the next Olympics in 1976, Lanny won the gold and then began teaching his “Mental Management System®.” Since then, he’s coached Olympic teams from all around the world and has also worked with the Navy SEALs, Fortune 500 businesses, the PGA and its players and other elite performers in sports and business. He boiled decades of wisdom into his fantastic book With Winning in Mind. He and I connected for an interview and I’ve been personally practicing many of his ideas for years.

One day a 697-pound guy stopped by and checked himself in—hoping that Joe could help him transform his life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs per that story I link to above, Joe “gave him a 25-pound sandbag, and had him carry it on long hikes every morning and evening. In return, he promised to carry his own sandbag, but with this twist: As the man lost weight, De Sena’s sandbag would get heavier.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story continues: “The man responded well to the challenge, losing two to three pounds a day at first, and eventually getting all the way down to 267 pounds. Meanwhile, De Sena’s sandbag increased to 85 pounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow… Joe wanted to use that experience as a symbol of his commitment to the world but he realized he couldn’t take an 85 pound (!!!) sandbag with him everywhere he went. So he asked his wife to get him a 20-pound kettlebell. She accidentally got him a 20 KILO (aka 44-pound kettlebell) and, well, here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s what I was thinking about this morning as I carried 100 pounds of sand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShort story there: Every day I hit the Trail around sunrise. And, every day I carry something for the first (and last) 5 minutes of my hike. I alternate between carrying my shoes on off days (\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/fix-your-feet-philip-maffetone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFix Your Feet\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, baby!) and carrying my 50-pound Spartan sandbag or bucket of rocks on the alternating days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… Yesterday I carried my 50-pound sandbag up for the first 5 minutes of my workout. I plop it down (with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/thats-like-me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e“That’s like me!”\u003c/a\u003e) near the trailhead and proceed to do my Spartan warm up a la \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/spartan-fit-joe-de-sena-john-durant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpartan Fit\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (which I also do every day): I skip out and back for 15 yards. Then I bear crawl forward and back for 10 yards. Then I do 11 air squats and then 2 sets of 5 pull-ups on the beams that support a trail map thingy. (Plus some quick wrist and ankle mobility movements in between the pull-up sets.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I hit the Trail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, usually when I loop back around to the trailhead, I pick up my sandbag and carry it back to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnly yesterday, my sandbag wasn’t there. (Hah.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor about 3 seconds I was like, “Did someone really take my sandbag?” Then I was like, “Wow. That’s awesome. I wonder who the Beast is that took the bag and where they took it!” “I bet it will be here tomorrow. Impressive!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, because I’m committed to always carrying something on my way up and down, I took my shoes off and carried them back to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast forward to this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hit the Trail. This time I brought my backup sandbag (yes, I have a backup! lol) and, sure enough, there’s my other sandbag right where I usually leave it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI smile and give a silent tip o’ the cap to the Spartan Beast who worked out with it yesterday and continued on with my workout.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, at the end of the loop, I had 100 pounds of sand to carry back. (And, it had been raining all day so… Does that make it even heavier? Hah.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which made me think of Joe and the fact that he carried an 85 (!!!) pound sandbag ANYWHERE for ANY distance. That’s crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI carried my two 50 pound bags for about 100 yards (max) and then dropped one bag, carried the other one to the car and headed back to pick up the second one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, I did that all with an ever \u003cem\u003edeeper\u003c/em\u003e level of respect for the fact that a) \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/big-ideas/obstacles-are-good-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eobstacles make us stronger\u003c/a\u003e and that b) the world needs more exemplars like Joe De Sena (and me and you and everyone else we can rally to the cause!) to BE THE CHANGE so we can change the world together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which leads us to Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, carrying heavy things may or not be your thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut… What IS your thing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you ALL IN?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlease be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePretty please.

His coach, Phil Maffetone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuper short story: There are two central pillars to Maffetone’s training approach: How you train and how you eat. Specifically: 1. Train in your aerobic zone (aka quit going anaerobic all the time) + 2. Burn fat for fuel (aka quit eating so much sugar and flour).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlightly longer story: When you train in your anaerobic zone, you burn sugar for fuel during your workout \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e you train your body to burn sugar for fuel the rest of the day. Enter: Cravings for sugar and carbs and extra weight/fat despite all that training. (Plus, potential fatigue and propensity for injuries.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, when you train in your AEROBIC zone (Maffetone calculates it via the super-simple formula of 180 minus your age for your upper limit then subtract 10 to get your aerobic range), you burn FAT for fuel during your workout AND you train your body to burn fat for fuel during the rest of the 24 hours of your day. If you ditch the sugar and flour and refined (aka junk) food, enter: Easily maintaining your optimal, lean body weight and a steady sense of energy all day every day without the injuries, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll be talking more about my adventures in endurance land in the months and years (and decades?!) ahead. (Including an interview with Maffetone that we’re scheduling—thank you, Ben Greenfield for connecting us.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, for now, all of that brings us back to my watch and the point of this +1 (beyond keeping you abreast of my adventures 🤓).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… To follow Maffetone’s Method, I needed to start tracking my heart rate as I trained. I started using my Polar strap + watch but it didn’t quite do the job. I got a Garmon wrist-based heart rate monitor but when I tested its accuracy vis-a-vis my oximeter and my Polar strap, it was so far off that it was essentially useless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I ran into a guy on the trail who raved about his Suunto and, after nearly succumbing to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/the-paradox-of-choice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eParadox of Choice\u003c/a\u003e looking at all the options, I found the Suunto Spartan Ultra.

Meet Suunto.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to tracking my training zones, precise routes, altitude gained and all kinds of other cool data on my workouts, the MEANING of the word “suunto” might be the coolest thing about my watch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnter: An unpaid ad. (Hah.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe company was founded in Finland in the 1930s. The first product was a compass. Here’s what’s cool: The word \u003cem\u003esuunto\u003c/em\u003e is Finnish for “direction.” As in, “What direction are you headed?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, every time I look at my Suunto and its little compass icon I think, “What direction am I headed?” “Yep.

(Think: Lion chasing you.)\n– Third: When you breathe through your mouth, you tend to “overbreathe” via short, shallow, fast breaths that disrupt the oxygen to carbon dioxide levels in your body. Although it might sound weird, it’s the CARBON DIOXIDE that actually gets the oxygen out of your red blood cells and into your tissues and organs and you need to slow down your breathing (via your nose!) to get the CO2 right and, as a result, the O2 where you want it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRule #2.

(Finish strong as we like to say at the Johnson house! 🙂)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSqueeze your diaphragm. Get all that air out. Why?

Here’s where it starts to get interesting…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContext: Spartan Races come in essentially three flavors: short, medium and long (usually up and down mountains and/or ski slopes, etc. with varying numbers of obstacles). The short is a 3- to 4-mile “Sprint.” The medium is a 6- to 8-mile “Super.” The long is a 12- to 14-mile “Beast”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore my first Beast, I’d done a Sprint and a Super but I’d never trained longer than my 3-mile daily hike so I didn’t even know if I could do the Beast. I (literally!) almost didn’t show up. I got to the starting line (always \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/get-to-the-starting-line/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethe most important obstacle\u003c/a\u003e!) and I did the Race at a leisurely pace. I finish it. (There’s no way I wasn’t finishing it. lol) I place a respectable but certainly not remarkable #1,270 out of 4,500 people in the Open division.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, we arrive at a few weekends ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI race this Beast with the competitive age-group guys. I place 7th out of those 149 guys which I’m pretty happy about as it puts me one step closer to hitting the target of being a world-class athlete via placing in the Top 10 for my age group in a qualifying event. (This one wasn’t a qualifying event so the competition wasn’t as stiff so it didn’t count, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what’s interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHad I raced in the Open division, my time would have placed me #10 out of 4,500+ people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… In a year, I effectively went from #1,270 to #10—from the 71.78th percentile to the 99.78th percentile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Now, to be clear: In terms of competing with the truly elite guys, I have a long way to go. But I find that absolutely fascinating…)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy is that relevant for our purposes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause I think the results had a LOT more to do with an IDENTITY shift than anything else. Sure, a year had lapsed. I trained a little more, I knew I could do that distance, etc. But what \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e changed was the fact that I was now living from the \u003cem\u003eIdentity\u003c/em\u003e of a World-Class Athlete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had made my decision that I was absolutely (!) going for the world-class standard and getting ready to see if my best could actually be the best in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy Identity PROFOUNDLY shifted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so did my behaviors. And so did my results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt has really made me wonder if my old triathlon coaches might have had a point… And, more importantly, where else I (and we) might be limiting ourselves in our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which brings us (thanks for sticking in—you’re an Endurance +1er!! 🙂) to the point of Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow’s your Identity?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you limiting yourself in unnecessary ways?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe telling yourself you’re just not _____________________ \u0026lt;- fill-in-the-blank-whatever?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat if that wasn’t true?

After a group of goat herders stumbled upon the SEALs and gave their location to Taliban soldiers, the Taliban attacked. Luttrell’s three teammates were killed and he was left to try to survive an enemy onslaught in an unfamiliar area. Luttrell was shot eleven times.

The words were written in Japanese kanji characters. Beneath these, he translated for us before we could ask: ‘Fall down seven times, get up eight.’ He then gave a beautiful account of the meaning in his broken English. What he conveyed was way more nuanced than the words alone implied. The main point he was making was not just that you should get up after falling down, but that what counts is how you get up.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow often have you ‘fallen down’ in life and reacted poorly, or risen with timidity, not adapting quickly to the new reality? …\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eReacting negatively to failure leads to more destabilization, worsening an already bad situation.

The resilient stare down their fear of falling off an obstacle and train to get back up right away with a positive response. Like [Marcus] Luttrell, they look for opportunity to turn lemons into lemonade. Fall down seven times, get up eight—stronger, better, and more capable, having learned everything possible from the situation.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThat’s adaptability.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I read that section, I immediately thought of Angela Duckworth.

<div class="line-clamp-2">I absolutely love the idea of *paying* to run through (and over and under and up and across) obstacles. It’s the perfect metpahor for life–which is one of the reasons why training for Spartan Races is my new sport-hobby. In this class, I share some of my favorite Big Ideas on how to become immune to obstacles in your life and, if you’re feeling it, do your first Race. The biggest obstacle you’ll face?

<div class="line-clamp-2">Joe De Sena created Spartan Race. He's one of my favorite people on the planet. His mission? To "yank 100 million people off their couches to start living instead of being passive observers of life.” Angela Duckworth calls him a "paragon of grit" and, as you know if you've been following along, I'm ALL IN on Spartan Races as an epically awesome way to use obstacles to make ourselves stronger. We featured his first two books Spartan Up! and Spartan Fit! In this one, Joe walks us through the ten Spartan Core Virtues—from Self-Awareness and Commitment to Grit and Integrity. If you’re into embodying the classic virtues of ancient Greece as much as I am, I think you’ll dig the book as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore: A quick look at our Top 10 Spartan Virtues, how to find your True North, commitment (do you know what it *truly* is?), marshmallows (and our six-year-old sons), and what you'll know at the finish line (get there!!).</div>

He’s also, as Angela Duckworth, author of Grit, tells us: “a paragon of grit” who “shows you how you’re capable of so much more than you think.” A paragon of grit. That’s the perfect description. After inspiring us with stories of real-life heroes and ancient Spartan lore, De Sena walks us through the seven pillars of Spartan training + a 30-day plan to get Spartan Fit. Big Ideas we explore include getting to the starting line, developing obstacle immunity, making thousands of small decisions and your gritty oath.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Trevor Moawad is a mental conditioning coach to elite performers. He is well known for being the mental coach to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and has worked closely with prestigious NCAA football programs and coaches, the US Special Operations community, Major League Baseball, and the NBA. This book is, as per the sub-title, all about “How to Think Neutrally and Gain Control of Your Life.” I loved it and, if you’re also equally fired up by the mental toughness in sports and life genre, I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include neutral thinking (much better than positive or negative), goats and G.O.A.T.s, the law of substitution (focus!), the illusion of choice (if you’re REALLY ALL IN, there is no choice), and drawing a line in the dirt (and getting to it… again and again and again!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Christopher McDougall is a brilliant story teller (and author of Born to Run). In this great book, he weaves together a number of different narratives, with an emphasis on two: one about an extraordinary wartime adventure on Crete and the other about Natural Movement. In the process, he shares a ton of Ideas on how we can each tap into the extraordinary superpowers latent within. Big Ideas we explore include the ancient Greek meaning of the word “hero,” the mantra of the hero, why weeds + fat are optimal fuel and a great test.</div>

If you’re a triathlete you know he’s a legend. For those who might not know, Allen won the Ironman world championships an unprecedented six times. Triathlete magazine voted him the greatest triathlete of all time. You know his secret? Maffetone. In this book we get an overview of The Maffetone Method. Big Ideas we cover include the importance of remembering it's all about health AND fitness, making your workouts feel like a GIFT rather than a chore, how to build a super-strong aerobic base while burning fat for fuel and tracking it all via your #1 piece of equipment: that workout diary of yours with goals (what are yours?), strategies (yours?) and workouts (how're yours?).

<div class="line-clamp-2">Tim Grover was Michael Jordan’s trainer and, basically, his mental toughness coach. Kobe Bryant’s as well. And Dwayne Wade’s. And... Well, a ton of other elite athletes. He’s one of the world’s top mental toughness coaches and this book is, as per the sub-title, a manual on how to go “From Good to Great to Unstoppable.” Big Ideas we explore include: relentless commitment (vs. "Meh, good enough"), Do. The. Work (eat frogs and dominate), Pressure (pressure, pressure! BRING IT ON!), the source of true confidence, greatness math (remember: effort counts twice; just ask Michael Jordan and Jerry Rice), and turning your dreams into reality (ready?).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Phil Maffetone is a brilliant, iconoclastic philosopher-coach. He’s one of the best endurance coaches ever and has been advocating a fat-burning approach to ultra-endurance for decades. The sub-title to this book captures the essence of all his work perfectly: “How to Achieve Your Athletic Potential, Stay Healthy and Get the Most Out of Your Body.” This "Endurance Handbook" is basically an abridged version of "The Big Book of Endurance." As I was shining a flash light into all the nooks and crannies of Maffetone’s brain that I could find (hah), I kinda thought of these two books as a sort of parallel to Epictetus’s "Discourses" (the “Big Book”!) and "Enchiridion" (the “Handbook”!). Big Ideas we explore include Rule #1 (first, do no harm!), Rule #2 (build your aerobic base!), the importance of fat burning (and how to build it), the #1 pro tip (ELIMINATE SUGAR!!!), body economy 101 (uncapping your athletic potential), and winning the ultimate endurance race: life (see you at 100!).</div>

<p class="!pb-0">by<!-- --> <span><a class="font-normal text-red transition-colors hover:text-red-700" href="/authors/dr-philip-maffetone">Dr. Philip Maffetone</a></span></p>
<div class="line-clamp-2">Phil Maffetone is one of the greatest (if not THE) greatest endurance coaches ever. He’s coached everyone from the best triathlete in history (Mark Allen) to some of the best race car drivers (like the Andretti brothers). He even toured with The Red Hot Chilli Peppers as their wellness coach and helped Rick Rubin Optimize his life. This book is a fun look at Maffetone’s perspective on how to go about breaking the elusive 2-hour marathon. As he says in the sub-title, it’s all about “how it will go down” AND “what it can teach all runners about training and racing.” If you’re a marathoner, this might be the perfect way to get introduced to Maffetone’s core ideas. I loved it as another way to drill Maffetone’s core ideas into my mind and training methodology. It’s basically a holistic look at all the marginal gains we can apply to reach our running potential. Big Ideas we cover include a quick look at just how fast a 1:59 pace is (sub-4:35 min mile for 26.2 miles = CRAZY fast!), the importance of the MIND in hitting the target, why AEROBIC speed is so important (plus, what it is and how to train it), the ideal training schedule (is super dynamic and personal), how to run properly (hot coal technique!), and balancing the catabolic + anabolic phases of training.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">John Kavanagh is one of the best MMA coaches in the world. He runs Straight Blast Gym Ireland and has been coaching the superstar Conor McGregor—one of the best MMA fighters in history—since the day he got into MMA and arrived in his gym. John was also Ireland’s first MMA fighter and its first Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt. Plus, he’s a down-to-earth, humble guy. This is his inspiring story about his journey to the top and it reads like a case study in the growth mindset and grit. Big Ideas we cover include the fact that “Win or Learn” is literally THE PERFECT mantra for the growth mindset, Conor's path from welfare to $100m, the goldfish-bowl effect (need to hop out of your bowl?), standing up and falling down (and then getting back up!), loving what we do as the secret sauce to awesome (science says!!) and remembering that there's no easy route to any destination worth getting to.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Lanny Bassham is one of my favorite teachers. He’s an Olympic Gold Medalist and World Champion rifle shooter. He won a silver medal after having what he calls a “mental meltdown” in the 1972 Olympics. Then he spent several hours a day for the next couple years talking to every gold medalist he could find about how they were THINKING while they were performing at such an elite level. In the next Olympics in 1976, Lanny won the gold and then began teaching his “Mental Management System®.” Since then, he’s coached Olympic teams from all around the world and has also worked with the Navy SEALs, Fortune 500 businesses, the PGA and its players and other elite performers in sports and business. He boiled decades of wisdom into his fantastic book With Winning in Mind. He and I connected for an interview and I’ve been personally practicing many of his ideas for years. Then recently sent me a copy of his latest book — this one. I read it the next day. It’s AWESOME. And, well, here we are. Of course, it’s packed with Big Ideas and, as always, I’m excited to share some of my favorites!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Originally published in 1974, this book is, as the sub-title suggests, the classic guide to the mental side of peak performance and transcends tennis/sports. If we want to win the game of life, we've gotta start by winning the inner game. In the Note, we'll take a quick look at how to do that, learning about Self 1 + Self 2 (and how to help them get along), quieting our mind and asking for qualities we aspire to have.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Alan Stein is a peak-performance coach who was immersed in the basketball world for fifteen years and now applies that wisdom to the broader game of life. I’m a huge fan of peak performance books, especially those with sports themes so I enjoyed this book. It’s broken down into three parts, capturing the various roles we play in life and work: Part I: Player, Part II: Coach and Part III: Team. Each section features a set of five core virtues we need to master and integrate across each domain. Big Ideas we explore include the importance of Self-Awareness (it's virtue #1!!), two case studies on discipline (featuring Steph Curry and Kobe Bryant), the comparison game (note: you will always (!) lose), the five virtues of being a great Coach, and one more rep (up Hell on the Hill).</div>

Maffetone is one of the greatest (if not THE) greatest endurance coaches ever. He’s coached everyone from the best triathlete in history (Mark Allen) to some of the best race car drivers (like the Andretti brothers). He even toured with The Red Hot Chilli Peppers as their wellness coach and helped Rick Rubin Optimize his life. This book is a fun look at Maffetone’s perspective on how to go about breaking the elusive 2-hour marathon. As he says in the sub-title, it’s all about “how it will go down” AND “what it can teach all runners about training and racing.” If you’re a marathoner, this might be the perfect way to get introduced to Maffetone’s core ideas. I loved it as another way to drill Maffetone’s core ideas into my mind and training methodology. It’s basically a holistic look at all the marginal gains we can apply to reach our running potential. Big Ideas we cover include a quick look at just how fast a 1:59 pace is (sub-4:35 min mile for 26.2 miles = CRAZY fast!), the importance of the MIND in hitting the target, why AEROBIC speed is so important (plus, what it is and how to train it), the ideal training schedule (is super dynamic and personal), how to run properly (hot coal technique!), and balancing the catabolic + anabolic phases of training.3b:T459,Lanny Bassham is one of my favorite teachers. He’s an Olympic Gold Medalist and World Champion rifle shooter. He won a silver medal after having what he calls a “mental meltdown” in the 1972 Olympics. Then he spent several hours a day for the next couple years talking to every gold medalist he could find about how they were THINKING while they were performing at such an elite level. In the next Olympics in 1976, Lanny won the gold and then began teaching his “Mental Management System®.” Since then, he’s coached Olympic teams from all around the world and has also worked with the Navy SEALs, Fortune 500 businesses, the PGA and its players and other elite performers in sports and business.

He won six Ironman World Championships and \u003cem\u003eTriathlete\u003c/em\u003e magazine recently voted him the greatest triathlete ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis secret? His coach, Phil Maffetone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuper short story: There are two central pillars to Maffetone’s training approach: How you train and how you eat. Specifically: 1. Train in your aerobic zone (aka quit going anaerobic all the time) + 2. Burn fat for fuel (aka quit eating so much sugar and flour).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlightly longer story: When you train in your anaerobic zone, you burn sugar for fuel during your workout \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e you train your body to burn sugar for fuel the rest of the day. Enter: Cravings for sugar and carbs and extra weight/fat despite all that training. (Plus, potential fatigue and propensity for injuries.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, when you train in your AEROBIC zone (Maffetone calculates it via the super-simple formula of 180 minus your age for your upper limit then subtract 10 to get your aerobic range), you burn FAT for fuel during your workout AND you train your body to burn fat for fuel during the rest of the 24 hours of your day. If you ditch the sugar and flour and refined (aka junk) food, enter: Easily maintaining your optimal, lean body weight and a steady sense of energy all day every day without the injuries, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll be talking more about my adventures in endurance land in the months and years (and decades?!) ahead. (Including an interview with Maffetone that we’re scheduling—thank you, Ben Greenfield for connecting us.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, for now, all of that brings us back to my watch and the point of this +1 (beyond keeping you abreast of my adventures 🤓).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… To follow Maffetone’s Method, I needed to start tracking my heart rate as I trained. I started using my Polar strap + watch but it didn’t quite do the job. I got a Garmon wrist-based heart rate monitor but when I tested its accuracy vis-a-vis my oximeter and my Polar strap, it was so far off that it was essentially useless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I ran into a guy on the trail who raved about his Suunto and, after nearly succumbing to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/the-paradox-of-choice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eParadox of Choice\u003c/a\u003e looking at all the options, I found the Suunto Spartan Ultra. I thought to myself, “How can I NOT get that?” (Laughing.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, here we are. Meet Suunto.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to tracking my training zones, precise routes, altitude gained and all kinds of other cool data on my workouts, the MEANING of the word “suunto” might be the coolest thing about my watch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnter: An unpaid ad. (Hah.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe company was founded in Finland in the 1930s. The first product was a compass. Here’s what’s cool: The word \u003cem\u003esuunto\u003c/em\u003e is Finnish for “direction.” As in, “What direction are you headed?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, every time I look at my Suunto and its little compass icon I think, “What direction am I headed?” “Yep.

You breathing through your \u003cstrong\u003enose\u003c/strong\u003e? (Most people don’t. Go look around and/or in the mirror. Do you see a mouth gaping open?)\n2. Do you breathe deeply (yet calmly) into your \u003cstrong\u003ebelly\u003c/strong\u003e? (Most people don’t—especially if you breathe through your mouth!)\n3. And, is your \u003cstrong\u003eexhale\u003c/strong\u003e slightly longer than your inhale?

(Think: Lion chasing you.)\n– Third: When you breathe through your mouth, you tend to “overbreathe” via short, shallow, fast breaths that disrupt the oxygen to carbon dioxide levels in your body. Although it might sound weird, it’s the CARBON DIOXIDE that actually gets the oxygen out of your red blood cells and into your tissues and organs and you need to slow down your breathing (via your nose!) to get the CO2 right and, as a result, the O2 where you want it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRule #2.

(Finish strong as we like to say at the Johnson house! 🙂)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSqueeze your diaphragm. Get all that air out. Why? Well, did you know that breathing is responsible for 70% (!!!) of your body’s detoxification? Elimination and sweat only take care of 30%. (Kinda surprising, eh?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, guess what? If you’re not breathing right, you’re not detoxifying fully.

I place 7th out of those 149 guys which I’m pretty happy about as it puts me one step closer to hitting the target of being a world-class athlete via placing in the Top 10 for my age group in a qualifying event. (This one wasn’t a qualifying event so the competition wasn’t as stiff so it didn’t count, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what’s interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHad I raced in the Open division, my time would have placed me #10 out of 4,500+ people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… In a year, I effectively went from #1,270 to #10—from the 71.78th percentile to the 99.78th percentile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Now, to be clear: In terms of competing with the truly elite guys, I have a long way to go.

The resilient stare down their fear of falling off an obstacle and train to get back up right away with a positive response. Like [Marcus] Luttrell, they look for opportunity to turn lemons into lemonade.
