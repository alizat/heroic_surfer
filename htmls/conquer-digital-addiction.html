At the same time, we feel disconnected from ourselves, from others and from the world at large.” Their solution? We need to overhaul our mind’s operating system. How?

I read and listened to a few Philosopher Notes and some +1’s, and thought Brian did a great job in presenting some key ideas.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI was very busy expanding our business and I didn’t have much time to do the program in depth when it started. I would listen to the Weekly Coaching training a day or so later, and then at the end of August something hit me…. I believe it was the PM and AM Bookend sessions that began the revolution :)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI then began the process of listening to the Core Wisdom requirements. I began my daily journaling, my Masterpiece Day Worksheets (I am at 72 days straight), 12 minutes of daily Meditation, optimal breathing, eating better, and following the plan.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe removal of the news, TV, the internet (except for work), social media — and going to bed instead — has created an energy I have not had in 20 years. I’ve lost 12 pounds since September and am about 5 pounds from my ideal weight of 168 lbs. My worldview has changed drastically as well. I look forward to the challenges/obstacles, instead of dreading them. I do the things now I would in the past put off until later. I could go on and on\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI would highly recommend going through the Heroic Coach program, even if you are a busy executive.

He found solace in comic books as they were both easy to read and packed with inspiring models.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s a remarkable storyteller and tells us the remarkable story of his fascination with the X-Men. He loved them the most because they were mutants with special powers who were often rejected by people who didn’t understand them and their powers. He felt like a mutant as a result of his learning challenges and shyness. Only, without the superpowers. 😕\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe grew up in New York and, one day, he learned that X-Men’s school, Professor Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, was located near him in Westchester County, a suburb of New York City.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, you know what he did as a nine year old? He rode around his neighborhood on his bike looking for the school!!! (He actually has a picture of him on his bike as that kid. It’s epic.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast-forward a couple decades. He’s coaching the Chairman and CEO of 20th Century Fox and his executive team. They hit it off. As it turns out, they’re in the middle of producing the latest X-Men. And, guess what Jim gets to do? Fly on the X-Jet with the crew to the set where he gets to hang out and coach the actors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst scene? Well, of course, that was in Professor Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack to you and superheroes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJim tells us: \u003cem\u003e“I’m a firm believer that we all have incredible superpowers that are waiting to be awakened. I’m not talking about the ability to fly, create iron-clad armor, or shoot lasers from your eyes, but real-life practical abilities like flying through books, iron-clad memory, laser focus, boundless creativity, clear thinking, mindfulness, superior mental attitude, and more. We are all superheroes in one way or another.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJust as every superhero has powers, so do they have arch nemeses. Enter the supervillain. Think the Joker to Batman, Lex Luthor to Superman. The villains we face may not look the same as they do in the movies, but they’re still the bad guys—the ones you, as a superhero, need to vanquish and hold at bay. Modern-day supervillains get in our way and make life harder, keeping us from our potential. They hold us back and rob us of our productivity, prosperity, positivity, and peace of mind. And it’s up to us to recognize and defeat them.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack to YOU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’re the Superhero of your life’s story. And, as with any and all great superhero adventures, you have some supervillains with which you need to contend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou know what Jim tells us is the ultimate bane of our existence?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTechnology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be fair, he says: \u003cem\u003e“To be clear, technology is a vital part of progress and being limitless. It allows us to do everything from connecting to learning, making our lives that much more convenient. But it is possible that we are consuming digital technology at a rate that even its creators would find extreme. Much of the technology available to us today is so new that we don’t know the level at which we need to control our interaction with it. …\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur community has expressed a growing concern about their overreliance on technology and they come to us to upgrade their brains to find relief from these ‘four horsemen’ of our age: digital deluge, digital distraction, digital dementia, and digital deduction. It’s important to note that overload, distraction, forgetfulness, and default thinking have been around for ages. While technology doesn’t cause these conditions, it has great potential to amplify them.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJim calls those four “digital” supervillains the 4 D’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDigital deluge. Digital distraction. Digital dementia. Digital deduction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s take a quick look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, we’re DELUGED with an overload of information. Get this:\u003cem\u003e “Compared to the 15th century, we now consume as much data in a single day as an average person from the 1400s would have absorbed in an entire lifetime.”\u003c/em\u003e ← WOWsers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, we’re DISTRACTED by all this digital stimuli. “Instead of relaxing into the downtime that we might experience when waiting in line, waiting for a bus or an appointment, etc., we pull out our phones and train our distraction muscles.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThird, we’re experiencing DEMENTIA or a “breakdown of cognitive abilities” as a result of our overreliance on technology. \u003cem\u003e“There’s research that says our brains are more like a muscle, rather than a hard drive that fills up. That the more you use it, the stronger it gets, and the more it can store. The question is: Are we making those choices consciously, or are we acting out of unconscious habit?”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFourth, we’re losing our power of DEDUCTION when we can so quickly turn to digital sources of information to let us know how we should be thinking about something in our lives. \u003cem\u003e“The upshot is that deduction—an amalgam of critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity that is an essential skill for being limitless—is becoming automated.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose four are bad enough but… Jim tells us that there’s a fifth D: Digital Depression which he says is \u003cem\u003e“a result of the comparison culture that emerges when we let the highlight reels of the social media feeds of others cause us to perceive ourselves as less than.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(I’d add that the Depression naturally \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/goeswith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003egoeswith\u003c/a\u003e the “Enervated Anxiety” we feel when we’re constantly plugged in and don’t give ourselves the time to truly unplug and replenish our \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/training-tranquility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eEnergized Tranquility\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, we talk about this a lot.

<a class="flex justify-between" href="/101/conquering-digital-addiction"><h2>Conquering Digital Addiction 101</h2></a><h4>T​o sculpt or to be hacked? that is the question</h4>
<div class="line-clamp-2">​​Technology is, obviously, awesome. We’ve been using “tech” tools for 2.5 million years since our protohuman ancestors first picked up a stone and used it as a tool. 1.8 million years ago, “we” figured out how to make an acheulean hand axe which was a pretty epic innovation at the time.
​​
​​So, with the advent of smartphones in what’s known as the “Input Age,” I’m not suggesting we should all become tech-smashing Luddites. But… (And this is a big but!), I also don’t think we should underestimate just how much we play the role of addicted users caught up in the mix of a $7 TRILLION attention economics (/mind-hacking!) industry.
​​
​​The solution: Become Optimizites—use technology wisely to become the BEST you rather than mindlessly let your 1 million-year-old prefrontal cortex get hacked all day every day.
​​

Enter: Our new philosophy of technology use: Digital Minimalism. Enter: My SUPER strong recommendation of the book and my ALL IN commitment to helping create a movement around the ideas in the book. As you know, I rarely say a book is a must read but this book is as close as it gets. Big Ideas we explore include the fact that your soul is engaged in a lopsided arms race, a definition + overview of digital minimalism, the importance of spending time alone (and the consequences of *not* spending adequate time alone), reclaiming leisure (get active!) and joining the Attention Resistance.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Irresistible. That’s the perfect word to describe the growing array of addictive technologies that are capturing so much of our attention these days. And, it’s the perfect name for the book. Adam Alter is an associate professor of marketing at NYU’s Stern School of Business. This is a great book on, as the sub-title suggests, “The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.” Big Ideas we explore include the fact Steve Jobs didn’t let his own kids use an iPad (why?), why addiction is about more than just personality (and what matters), how to add 11 years back to your life, what happens when your brain gets pickled and the simple question you can ask to Optimize.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Nir Eyal is a former lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. His first book was an international bestseller that’s influenced the product development of pretty much all of the leading tech companies on the planet. It was called Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. We have Nir to thank for helping make the technology we use better. And... As he says, “But there’s also a dark side. As philosopher Paul Virilio wrote, ‘When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck.’ In the case of user-friendly products and services, what makes some products engaging and easy to use can also make them distracting.” After finding HIMSELF hooked to many of the products created by designers inspired by *his* work, Eyal got himself UNHOOKED and, ultimately INDISTRACTABLE. In this great book, he gives us a practical look at *why* we’re so vulnerable to getting hooked in the first place and, most importantly, how to make ourselves Indistractable so we can control our attention and choose our lives.</div>

I found the book fascinating and a great complement to our collection on how to conquer digital addiction. Big Ideas we explore include how to tame that monkey in your mind, email apnea (you breathing?!), the fact that "entanglement" tech is over 1 million years old ("Hi, stone tools!"), the big costs of task switching (and an easy way to feel its effects), the importance of experimenting (w/an experiment you can do today), the Latin wisdom solvitur ambulando ("it is solved by walking") and how to be an Optimizite rather than a Luddite. :)</div>

Big Ideas we explore include the importance of prioritizing prioritizing (aka quit blowing your brain up), how to decrease your IQ by 15 points (hah—seriously—here’s how to be 3 times less effective than someone stoned! :0), why your basal ganglia is awesome, and how to rock the seesaw that is your limbic system + prefrontal cortex.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">David Perlmutter is one of my favorite nutrition-physicians. We have Notes on a bunch of his books including Grain Brain, Brain Maker, and Power Up Your Brain. So, when I heard about the new book that he wrote with his son Austin (who is also an MD), I was excited to read it. It’s called Brain Wash. (It’s kinda like Digital Minimalism written by nutrition-neurologist-physicians. )
As David and Austin say, the book builds on a simple premise: “Our brain’s performance is being gravely manipulated, resulting in behaviors that leave us more lonely, anxious, depressed, distrustful, illness-prone, and overweight than ever before. At the same time, we feel disconnected from ourselves, from others and from the world at large.” Their solution? We need to overhaul our mind’s operating system. How? Via a “brain wash.” They walk us through the factors that lead to what they call “disconnection syndrome” and, of course, how to deal with it.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fourth Note on one of Ryan Holiday’s books. Ryan is one of my absolute favorite writers. One of the testimonials in the front of the book perfectly captures my sentiment. Screenwriter and director Brian Koppelman (Rounders, Ocean’s Thirteen and Billions) puts it this way: “I don’t have many rules in life, but one I never break is: If Ryan Holiday writes a book, I read it as soon as I can get my hands on it.” (btw: Cal Newport’s the first testimonial. He says: “Some authors give advice. Ryan Holiday distills wisdom. This book is a must read.”) Penguin Random House sent me an advance copy of this book. As I knew it would be: It’s fantastic.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Solitude. It’s the secret sauce to leadership. But... In their great book Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin tells us: “Solitude is a state of mind, a space where you can focus on your own thoughts without distraction, with a power to bring mind and soul together in clear-eyed conviction. Like a great wave that saturates everything in its path, however, handheld devices and other media now leave us awash with the thoughts of others. We are losing solitude without even realizing it.” Big Ideas we explore include the big 4 of solitude (clarity + creativity + emotional balance + moral courage), the threats from our "Input Age," how MLK and Eisenhower used solitude, FOMO (get over it!) and how to change the world (starting with YOU!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Manoush Zomorodi is the host of WNYC’s (New York’s public radio station) popular podcast and show called Note to Self. She decided to do a little challenge with her listeners. 20,000 (!) people participated in her 7-day “Bored and Brilliant” challenge. This book is the result of all she (and her community) learned. Big Ideas we cover include how to drop into your default mode (aka imagination engine) via boredom, daydreaming (three ways to do it: the good, the bad and the ugly!), challenge #1: observe yourself!

That the more you use it, the stronger it gets, and the more it can store.
