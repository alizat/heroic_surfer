I figured it would be fun to swing back home and pick up the kids and bring them to the Trail for the second part of my workout. So, that’s what I did. Eleanor walked (or, shall I say, toddled) the first 10 minutes then I put her in a pack on my chest and we headed up the hill with her big brother Emerson. Awesome 25-pound weight for the bonus 3+ mile hike!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, the next morning I asked Emerson what would make his day awesome and he said, “To go on a hike with you!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, my morning hikes are kinda like meditation for me and I LOVE doing it by myself but I also LOVE the fact that he was so excited to do a hike with me so I said, “AWESOME!

It hurts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI take a closer look and, lo and behold, his fingers are covered with these little prickly things. They’re super tiny but there are a ton of them.

Most of the titles for the series have the word “Mystery” in it. Like “The Yellow House Mystery” or “The Lighthouse Mystery.” That kinda thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… I say that we should call our day’s adventure “The Mystery of the Hairy Fingers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo which we laugh even harder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he says, “You should write about this in a +1.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo which I say, “That’s a great idea.

He had a 5-year-old like me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen another guy who was also waiting to chat stepped up and said, “Yah. I’d love to hear your thoughts on that. I have a 10-year-old and a 9-year-old as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was struck by how cool it was that these super-successful and ambitious guys were so committed to being great dads. (I also remember a coaching session with another successful entrepreneur. When I asked him what he most wanted to get out of our time together, he said that he wanted to be a better father. I actually get tears in my eyes as I think about that.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, I briefly told them about the etymology of the word “parent.” As we discussed in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/bring-forth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis +1\u003c/a\u003e, the word \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e means “to bring forth.” Our primary job as parents is to simply help \u003cem\u003ebring forth\u003c/em\u003e the latent potential (genius!!) that is inherently within our kids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I shared three things that I think are the most powerful ways to help “bring forth” that awesomeness. Here they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eBe an Exemplar\u003c/strong\u003e. It’s a truism (because it’s true!!), but kids don’t listen to what we tell them to do, they model what we ACTUALLY do. Therefore, by far, the most important thing we can do for our kids is to be a shining, radiant demonstration of what we hope they will aspire to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ebtw: This is, by far, my greatest motivation as a human being, a man and a father. I want to break the cycle of my masculine lineage (my father was an alcoholic and his father was an alcoholic who killed himself) and help my son (and daughter!) actualize his (and her!) potential (without having to work through quite so much 💩. lol)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eGive Presence\u003c/strong\u003e. The second thing I shared is also ridiculously obvious: Be present. We ALL (!!!) know that presence is the greatest act of love. Yet… Most of us forget that most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution is astonishingly simple. Put your smartphone in airplane mode in another room when you spend time with your kids (and your spouse and, well, any human). This simple act removes the greatest barrier to our presence and provides the fastest route to both connecting with our kids and modeling the style of connection (see #1 on being an exemplar!) that will be so important for our kids in a more and more hyperconnected (and paradoxically disconnected) world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eEmbrace Challenges\u003c/strong\u003e. The third thing we talked about was the importance of embracing what \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/carol-dweck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCarol Dweck\u003c/a\u003e calls a “Growth Mindset.” I told the guys that her books \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/mindset-carol-dweck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMindset\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/self-theories-carol-dweck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSelf-theories\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e are fantastic and recommended my Notes on them for the quick review.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePractically speaking, I’ve been \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e deliberate in following Dweck’s advice to embrace challenges and always reward EFFORT not “ability.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, on the effort front, I say things like: “Nice trail running!” rather than “You’re a great trail runner!” Or, “I saw how hard you worked to climb up that slide—and that you almost fell then caught yourself and kept on going. Love how hard you tried!” rather than “You’re such a great climber!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the challenges front, Dweck tells us to talk about our own challenges and how we’re facing them and to “rub our hands together” with excitement when things are hard. I’m ALL ABOUT this. I literally rub my hands together any time something is challenging (on the most mundane things) and say, “Oh, wow! I love challenges.” Or when I watch Emerson do something hard—whether that’s build a Lego set or do our Spartan wall traverse—I say, “Ohhhhh!! AWESOME!! That one’s challenging! How fun!!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s almost surreal how much he’s embraced this. He once asked his nanny, “Do you love challenges? I DO!!!” (Laughing with some more mistiness thinking about that.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack to me and the two dads.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd YOU.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re a parent, how’s that going for you?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s working?

Watching Humphrey Bogart gather teary-eyed Ingrid Bergman into his arms may make your heart pound, but real-life romance is fueled by far more humdrum scenes. It is kept alive each time you let your spouse know he or she is valued during the grind of everyday life. In marriage, couples are always making what I call ‘bids’ for each other’s attention, affection, humor, or support. Bids can be as minor as asking for a backrub or as significant as seeking help in carrying the burden when an aging parent is ill. The partner responds to each bid either by turning toward the spouse or turning away. A tendency to turn toward your partner is the basis of trust, emotional connection, passion, and a satisfying sex life. Comical as it may sound, romance is strengthened in the supermarket aisle when your partner asks, ‘Are we out of butter?’ and you answer, ‘I don’t know. Let me go get some just in case,’ instead of shrugging apathetically. It grows when you know your spouse is having a bad day at work and you take a few seconds out of your schedule to send him an encouraging text. In all of these instances, partners are making a choice to turn toward rather than away.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Turning toward” our partner instead of away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGottman tells us that our partners are always making “bids” for our attention. Whether we accept their invitation to connect or not is one of the greatest predictors of the longevity of our relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet this: Gottman did a 6-year follow-up study of newlyweds.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Carol Dweck is one of the world’s leading researchers on the science of motivation. This book is a collection of brief essays on various aspects of “self-theories.” It’s essentially a bridge between her extensive academic research studies and her popular book Mindset. It’s amazing. Big Ideas we explore include the two frameworks (entity vs. incremental) and their two goals (performance vs. learning), attributional retraining (aka learning the best way to respond to failure!), and moving from contingent self-worth to wholehearted self-esteem.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This book is a scientific look at Purpose by one of the world’s leading developmental psychologists—a powerful look at how to cultivate purpose in our children (and, for that matter, ourselves) and why it’s so important. Big Ideas we explore include a definition of what it means to be purposeful (and a look at the alternatives), the #1 thing that gets in the way of discovering and creating purpose, 9 key things parents can do to help their kids with purpose, why entrepreneurial spirit is so important and a four-word mantra to reduce timidity and build courage and confidence.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Did you know that Fred Rogers was an ordained Presbyterian minister who was given the unique charge of working with children and families through television? Yep. Since watching the documentary Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, I’ve fallen in love with the man and his “relentless commitment to all that is best in people.” This is a quick-reading collection of some of Fred’s best wisdom gems gathered from various sources and organized by different themes. Big Ideas we explore include: Your eulogy (in three words!), an enraged Mister Rogers (= fierce love in action), a barrelful of songs (your barrel overflowing?), swimming with Fred (143!!), and making goodness attractive (remember our #1 job: ENCOURAGE others!!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our third Note on (Mister) Fred Rogers’ books. I read all three over the course of a week after falling in love with the man via the wonderful documentary Won’t You Be My Neighbor? This book, as per the sub-title, is all about “Wisdom for Parents and Children from Mister Rogers.” Like the other books we’ve featured, it’s a super quick-reading and equally inspiring collection of brief wisdom gems from our beloved neighbor. I loved it. And, I’ve been enjoying channeling Mister Rogers’ warmth and presence and wisdom in my role as a father to our two little E’s: Emerson (6 as I type this) and Eleanor (2!). Big Ideas we explore include how to deal with disappointment (big and small!), growing (kids AND parents), the complexity of being a parent, setting limits and the power of saying, "I'm sorry."</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book after watching the wonderful (!) documentary on Mister Rogers called Won’t You Be My Neighbor? It's a collection of wisdom gems from various sources-a quick-reading portal into Mister Rogers’ brain that has an amazingly calming, uplifting effect. (At least it did for me.) Simply reading his words seemed to elevate my consciousness and make me a kinder, more patient person. Big Ideas we explore include: Be the best at whatever you are, our #1 Job in life (hint: Encourage others!!), I Like You (just the way you are), being a living example, Mister Rogers' creativity (hello, torture!), perfect parents/kids?

<div class="line-clamp-2">Carol Dweck, Ph.D is a Stanford Professor and one of the world’s leading authorities on the science of motivation. She tells us that our “mindset”—how we see the world—determines a *huge* part of our overall happiness and well-being and achievement. In this Note, we’ll explore the difference between a “fixed mindset” and a “growth mindset” and some Big Ideas on why we want to learn how to live from a growth mindset. And, of course, how to do it!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Lanny Bassham is one of my favorite teachers. He’s an Olympic Gold Medalist and World Champion rifle shooter. He won a silver medal after having what he calls a “mental meltdown” in the 1972 Olympics. Then he spent several hours a day for the next couple years talking to every gold medalist he could find about how they were THINKING while they were performing at such an elite level. In the next Olympics in 1976, Lanny won the gold and then began teaching his “Mental Management System®.” Since then, he’s coached Olympic teams from all around the world and has also worked with the Navy SEALs, Fortune 500 businesses, the PGA and its players and other elite performers in sports and business. He boiled decades of wisdom into his fantastic book With Winning in Mind. He and I connected for an interview and I’ve been personally practicing many of his ideas for years. Then recently sent me a copy of his latest book — this one. I read it the next day. It’s AWESOME. And, well, here we are. Of course, it’s packed with Big Ideas and, as always, I’m excited to share some of my favorites!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">The Last Lecture is an inspiring handbook for life written as a follow-up to a viral talk by Randy Pausch. Randy was a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When it became terminal, he gave his “last lecture.” The talk was recorded. It went viral. And this book was written with Jeffrey Zaslow as a follow-up. Over 20 million people have now watched that talk and, if you’re one of them, you know just how magnetically inspiring Randy is. The book features fifty-three micro chapters—each telling a different story from Randy’s life. It’s packed with wisdom and I’m excited to share some of my favorite Big Ideas so let’s jump straight in!</div>

Here they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eBe an Exemplar\u003c/strong\u003e. It’s a truism (because it’s true!!), but kids don’t listen to what we tell them to do, they model what we ACTUALLY do. Therefore, by far, the most important thing we can do for our kids is to be a shining, radiant demonstration of what we hope they will aspire to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ebtw: This is, by far, my greatest motivation as a human being, a man and a father. I want to break the cycle of my masculine lineage (my father was an alcoholic and his father was an alcoholic who killed himself) and help my son (and daughter!) actualize his (and her!) potential (without having to work through quite so much 💩. lol)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eGive Presence\u003c/strong\u003e. The second thing I shared is also ridiculously obvious: Be present. We ALL (!!!) know that presence is the greatest act of love. Yet… Most of us forget that most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution is astonishingly simple. Put your smartphone in airplane mode in another room when you spend time with your kids (and your spouse and, well, any human). This simple act removes the greatest barrier to our presence and provides the fastest route to both connecting with our kids and modeling the style of connection (see #1 on being an exemplar!) that will be so important for our kids in a more and more hyperconnected (and paradoxically disconnected) world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eEmbrace Challenges\u003c/strong\u003e.

Love how hard you tried!” rather than “You’re such a great climber!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the challenges front, Dweck tells us to talk about our own challenges and how we’re facing them and to “rub our hands together” with excitement when things are hard. I’m ALL ABOUT this. I literally rub my hands together any time something is challenging (on the most mundane things) and say, “Oh, wow!

Watching Humphrey Bogart gather teary-eyed Ingrid Bergman into his arms may make your heart pound, but real-life romance is fueled by far more humdrum scenes. It is kept alive each time you let your spouse know he or she is valued during the grind of everyday life. In marriage, couples are always making what I call ‘bids’ for each other’s attention, affection, humor, or support. Bids can be as minor as asking for a backrub or as significant as seeking help in carrying the burden when an aging parent is ill. The partner responds to each bid either by turning toward the spouse or turning away. A tendency to turn toward your partner is the basis of trust, emotional connection, passion, and a satisfying sex life. Comical as it may sound, romance is strengthened in the supermarket aisle when your partner asks, ‘Are we out of butter?’ and you answer, ‘I don’t know. Let me go get some just in case,’ instead of shrugging apathetically. It grows when you know your spouse is having a bad day at work and you take a few seconds out of your schedule to send him an encouraging text. In all of these instances, partners are making a choice to turn toward rather than away.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Turning toward” our partner instead of away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGottman tells us that our partners are always making “bids” for our attention.
