(Go Mater Dei!!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd… Let’s just say my athletic career ended abruptly at age 12. (Laughing.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which is fine. I went on to become the editor of the school newspaper, president of the largest (nerd) club on campus and carried a 4.whatever GPA and all that jazz en route to UCLA, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut my identity was smart nerd. Not Athlete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast-forward a decade. I’m now 28. I sold my first business and had enough time and money to take a little time off to figure out what I wanted to do when I grow up. I read a lot, traveled a bit, etc. And, I got into triathlon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI worked with some coaches. They put me on a 90-day training regimen (starting with a track \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/dr-philip-maffetone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMAF Test\u003c/a\u003e, btw). I did exactly what they told me to do. And, apparently, I had such quick gains that they told me I should train for the Olympics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI didn’t give their comment much thought. I thought they were just being nice—which, of course, \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e have been the only motivation behind their comments but… I wasn’t an “athlete” so I didn’t even \u003cem\u003econsider\u003c/em\u003e the possibility that I could actually be very (very!) good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… I dabbled in triathlon (\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/the-master/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eanti-Mastery\u003c/a\u003e!) for a very brief season and then moved on to whatever I moved on to next—never even coming remotely close to exploring my athletic potential.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast-forward again. This time 15 years or so to a few weekends ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do my third Spartan Beast. It’s almost exactly one year after my first one. Here’s where it starts to get interesting…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContext: Spartan Races come in essentially three flavors: short, medium and long (usually up and down mountains and/or ski slopes, etc. with varying numbers of obstacles). The short is a 3- to 4-mile “Sprint.” The medium is a 6- to 8-mile “Super.” The long is a 12- to 14-mile “Beast”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore my first Beast, I’d done a Sprint and a Super but I’d never trained longer than my 3-mile daily hike so I didn’t even know if I could do the Beast. I (literally!) almost didn’t show up. I got to the starting line (always \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/get-to-the-starting-line/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethe most important obstacle\u003c/a\u003e!) and I did the Race at a leisurely pace. I finish it. (There’s no way I wasn’t finishing it. lol) I place a respectable but certainly not remarkable #1,270 out of 4,500 people in the Open division.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, we arrive at a few weekends ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI race this Beast with the competitive age-group guys. I place 7th out of those 149 guys which I’m pretty happy about as it puts me one step closer to hitting the target of being a world-class athlete via placing in the Top 10 for my age group in a qualifying event. (This one wasn’t a qualifying event so the competition wasn’t as stiff so it didn’t count, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what’s interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHad I raced in the Open division, my time would have placed me #10 out of 4,500+ people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… In a year, I effectively went from #1,270 to #10—from the 71.78th percentile to the 99.78th percentile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Now, to be clear: In terms of competing with the truly elite guys, I have a long way to go.

Sure, a year had lapsed. I trained a little more, I knew I could do that distance, etc. But what \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e changed was the fact that I was now living from the \u003cem\u003eIdentity\u003c/em\u003e of a World-Class Athlete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had made my decision that I was absolutely (!) going for the world-class standard and getting ready to see if my best could actually be the best in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy Identity PROFOUNDLY shifted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so did my behaviors.

They were asked to read the letters on the wing of a nearby plane, which were actually part of an eye chart.

We modern people have fallen in love with the idea that we are in control of our lives, and this worldview gives rise to an impulse to resist failure, to fight against the very notion of it. But just like the modern trend to defy age, the battle against failure is a lost cause. Failure is inevitable. We all experience it, in forms large and small. It is in your past and it is in your future. People with a high courage quotient understand that failure is a risk much of the time and unavoidable some of the time. Rather than trying to tiptoe around failure, they simply accept it as part of the process of success.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s from a chapter called “Be Willing to Fail.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s packed with powerful, practical wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike this: “\u003cem\u003eFailure is a fantastic learning opportunity. Think of every time you have made a mistake and said to yourself, ‘Well, I will never do that again!’ A single instance of failure can serve as a powerful lifelong course correction. Failure also helps us regroup mentally and improve our skills and strategy so that later attempts at goals might be more successful. Where your courage quotient is concerned, here is the tricky part: you do not have to accept that failure feels good, just that it is inevitable and often beneficial. Accepting failure is not synonymous with actively pursuing failure or enjoying failure when it crashes down upon you. The trick is to acknowledge both the positive and the negative aspects of failure. You can tell yourself, ‘This does not feel good and I am very disappointed with myself,’ on the one hand, even as on the other you reassure yourself by saying, ‘This is also a growth opportunity for me. I will learn from this temporary experience and move on.’\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd this: “\u003cem\u003eWhere the courage quotient is concerned it is instructive to realize that not everyone reacts to failure, or even the prospect of failure, in the same way. Some people—as I have mentioned and as we have all seen—allow failure to overshadow their lives, restricting their decisions and leaving them embarrassed, timid, or withdrawn. Other people appear to take failure in stride and are able to move beyond it after experiencing its temporary psychological sting. Thomas Edison famously said, recalling countless problematic attempts to create a working light bulb, ‘I failed my way to success.’ Winston Churchill too might be among the resilient. He once said, ‘Success consists of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasm.’ Apparently the ability to reframe failure as part of a larger process— learning, say—is instrumental in being able to cope with it.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, well, that’s Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWant to Optimize your Courage Quotient?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe willing to fail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, reframe your past failures as fantastic learning opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen get out there and give us all the Wisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love you got.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTODAY.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"be-willing-to-fail","title":"Be Willing to Fail","subtitle":"Edison, Churchill and YOU!","videoThumbnail":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/videos/thumbnails/original/Optimize-01135-be-willing-to-fail-thumb.jpg","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PlusOne","id":"34538","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","contentType":"PLUSONE","audioUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/downloads/mp3s/files/Optimize-0286-genius-dress-code.mp3","number":286,"intro":"In his classic book on Creativity, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi walks us through the science of what makes extraordinary creators so","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn his classic book on \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/creativity-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCreativity\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u003c/a\u003e walks us through the science of what makes extraordinary creators so extraordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, one of the key facets of being a truly great creator is the willingness and ability to FOCUS your attention, eliminating distractions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Csikszentmihalyi puts it: “It is practically impossible to learn a domain deeply enough to make a change in it without dedicating all of one’s attention to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the process of giving their craft THAT much attention, some of the best creators out there might look a little weird.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, Csikszentmihalyi tells us about Albert Einstein.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Josh Waitzkin is an extraordinary human. Ever heard of the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer? That’s the story of Josh life. Literally. After a childhood and young adulthood spent dominating chess, Josh then went on to master Tai Chi and became a World Champion. But what he REALLY became was a master of learning and peak performance. Big Ideas we explore include the two approaches to leaning, the downward spiral (what it is and how to avoid it), honoring your unique disposition, investing in loss, knowing your goal (decent, good, great, among best!), the power of stress and recovery and the ultimate secret of mastery.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jim Kwik is a widely recognized world expert in memory improvement, brain optimization and accelerated learning and has “served as the brain coach to a who’s who of Hollywood’s elite, professional athletes, political leaders, and business magnates.” The best part of Jim’s story? After suffering a brain injury in kindergarten, he was described by a teacher as "the kid with a broken brain.” He struggled with learning for most of his life. Then he went antifragile on it and studied (and applied!) the science of how we learn. Fast-forward a couple decades and VOILA. Here we are. This book is REALLY (!) good. Big Ideas we explore include the Limitless Model (Mindset + Motivation + Methods), Supervillans (Digital: Deluge + Distraction + Dementia + Deduction + Depression), Learn FASTER (Forget + Act + State + Teach + Enter + Review), Learned Limitlessness (delete the LIEs and Optimize the BS!), and how to create sustainable Motivation (Purpose x Energy x Small Simple Steps).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Cal Newport is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Dartmouth who went on to MIT for his Ph.D. and is now a Professor at Georgetown. In this book, Cal shares the top ideas he gleaned from interviews with non-grind Phi Beta Kappa members at elite schools across the country. They had to perform well AND they had to achieve those results without grinding away. Their practices, although discovered independently, reflect the same wisdom shared in the science books. It’s great to see the overlap. Big Ideas: pseudo-work vs. real work (and a secret formula), conquering procrastination, when/where/how long should you study?, #1 way to learn (and #1 trap), the importance of spacing out your work and the power to choose your future via excellent grades.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">The Last Lecture is an inspiring handbook for life written as a follow-up to a viral talk by Randy Pausch. Randy was a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When it became terminal, he gave his “last lecture.” The talk was recorded. It went viral. And this book was written with Jeffrey Zaslow as a follow-up. Over 20 million people have now watched that talk and, if you’re one of them, you know just how magnetically inspiring Randy is. The book features fifty-three micro chapters—each telling a different story from Randy’s life. It’s packed with wisdom and I’m excited to share some of my favorite Big Ideas so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Carol Dweck, Ph.D is a Stanford Professor and one of the world’s leading authorities on the science of motivation. She tells us that our “mindset”—how we see the world—determines a *huge* part of our overall happiness and well-being and achievement. In this Note, we’ll explore the difference between a “fixed mindset” and a “growth mindset” and some Big Ideas on why we want to learn how to live from a growth mindset. And, of course, how to do it!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is Yuval Noah Harari's third book (and our third Note). His first two focused on the past (Sapiens) and the future (Homo Deus). In this one, we "zoom in on the here and now" as we take a look at 21 of the most important things to be thinking about in the 21st century. Like all of his books, this is a thoughtful and thought-provoking look at some globally Big Ideas. Although obviously outside the scope of our normal Optimizing, I think it's important stuff. In the Note we explore dealing with "Disillusionment" (the title of chapter #1) by switching from "panic to bewilderment"), the future of health care and driving (and jobs!), making sure we match our investment in developing AI with an equivalent investment in developing "human consciousness," what we should be teaching our kids (basically, how to Optimize!!), and Yuval's #1 practice: meditation.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Failure. Some of us lean into it and learn as much as we can from it, and some of us prefer to avoid thinking about it and/or pretend it never happened. As you may guess, one approach leads to dramatically better performance over the long run. (Hint: Seeing failure as feedback + learning opportunities is a very wise idea.)

He’s a clinical neuroscientist (love that phrase!) who has performed 115,000+ SPECT scans on his patients’ brains. (That’s a lot.) This book captures what he’s learned about optimizing our brains, why it’s important and how to do it. Big Ideas we explore include #ANTspray, wisdom from Fat Freddie the penguin, how hungry your brain is (did you know it’s 2% body weight but uses 20-30% of calories consumed?), and a bunch of other goodness.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Yuval Noah Harari is a brilliant historian and thinker. He has a PhD in history from Oxford and is a tenured professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. After finishing my Note on his first bestselling book Sapiens I immediately picked up this one. While Sapiens features a “A Brief History of Humankind,” Homo Deus gives us “A Brief History of Tomorrow.” Wonder what the future might look like and how artificial intelligence and biotechnology will fundamentally change the world and our species? Well, this is the book for you. It’s incredibly well-written and thoughtful and thought provoking. I HIGHLY recommend it. Big Ideas we explore include how Harari developed such an extraordinary mind (hint: 10,000+ hours of meditation and no smartphone), why we should study history (hint: to reimagine a better future), the 21st century's Big 3: Immortality + Happiness + Divinity (which results in an upgrade from Homo sapiens to Homo deus!), and algorithms--"arguably the single most important concept of the 21st century.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This book is “The True Story” of how, as per the sub-title, “a Lone Genius Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time.” (&lt;- The “Longitude” problem!) It’s a wonderfully written book by Dava Sobel, who combines her background in both astronomy and psychology to give us a behind-the-scenes look at the science and history of time, longitude, and seafaring all wrapped up in one epic heroic quest. If you’re looking for a fun, quick-reading, mind-expanding escape from the normal self-development literature, I think you’ll enjoy this hero-tale as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include: clocks and watches (and SUNDIALS!), time (as measured in heartbeats), longitude (vs. latitude), strengths (and weaknesses), encouraging a hero (how will you do so Today?!), Rome wasn’t built in a day (neither was anything awesome), elegant solutions (and the scientific establishment).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">As with all of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, this is a fascinating read—exploring the underpinnings of what *really* makes great people great. In short: It’s more complicated than we think and it’s *definitely* not simply innate talent. Culture and hard work and other often wacky variables play a pivotal role. Big Ideas we explore: The 10,000 Hour Rule, no naturals + no grinders, The Beatles (and their 1,200!! shows before they hit it big), Bill Gates sneaking out of bed in high school and the three keys to meaning.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">David Shenk is the award-winning and national-bestselling author of six books. He’s also a lecturer and filmmaker. His primary focus with this book is shining a bright light on the fact that the “Nature vs. Nurture” paradigm is a VERY limited way of looking at things. He tells us that the interaction between our genes and our environment is a much more nuanced, DYNAMIC PROCESS. Big Ideas we explore include Genes 1.0 vs. Genes 2.0 (think G+E vs. GxE), the Mozart Myth (remember: Talent is overrated!), deliberate practice (is where it's at), and how to be a genius (or merely great).</div>

You sit quietly in a class, you don’t talk to your neighbor, and you consume the information. But learning is not a spectator sport.

This time 15 years or so to a few weekends ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do my third Spartan Beast. It’s almost exactly one year after my first one. Here’s where it starts to get interesting…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContext: Spartan Races come in essentially three flavors: short, medium and long (usually up and down mountains and/or ski slopes, etc. with varying numbers of obstacles). The short is a 3- to 4-mile “Sprint.” The medium is a 6- to 8-mile “Super.” The long is a 12- to 14-mile “Beast”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore my first Beast, I’d done a Sprint and a Super but I’d never trained longer than my 3-mile daily hike so I didn’t even know if I could do the Beast.

I place 7th out of those 149 guys which I’m pretty happy about as it puts me one step closer to hitting the target of being a world-class athlete via placing in the Top 10 for my age group in a qualifying event.

We modern people have fallen in love with the idea that we are in control of our lives, and this worldview gives rise to an impulse to resist failure, to fight against the very notion of it. But just like the modern trend to defy age, the battle against failure is a lost cause. Failure is inevitable. We all experience it, in forms large and small. It is in your past and it is in your future. People with a high courage quotient understand that failure is a risk much of the time and unavoidable some of the time. Rather than trying to tiptoe around failure, they simply accept it as part of the process of success.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s from a chapter called “Be Willing to Fail.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s packed with powerful, practical wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike this: “\u003cem\u003eFailure is a fantastic learning opportunity. Think of every time you have made a mistake and said to yourself, ‘Well, I will never do that again!’ A single instance of failure can serve as a powerful lifelong course correction. Failure also helps us regroup mentally and improve our skills and strategy so that later attempts at goals might be more successful. Where your courage quotient is concerned, here is the tricky part: you do not have to accept that failure feels good, just that it is inevitable and often beneficial. Accepting failure is not synonymous with actively pursuing failure or enjoying failure when it crashes down upon you. The trick is to acknowledge both the positive and the negative aspects of failure. You can tell yourself, ‘This does not feel good and I am very disappointed with myself,’ on the one hand, even as on the other you reassure yourself by saying, ‘This is also a growth opportunity for me. I will learn from this temporary experience and move on.’\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd this: “\u003cem\u003eWhere the courage quotient is concerned it is instructive to realize that not everyone reacts to failure, or even the prospect of failure, in the same way. Some people—as I have mentioned and as we have all seen—allow failure to overshadow their lives, restricting their decisions and leaving them embarrassed, timid, or withdrawn. Other people appear to take failure in stride and are able to move beyond it after experiencing its temporary psychological sting. Thomas Edison famously said, recalling countless problematic attempts to create a working light bulb, ‘I failed my way to success.’ Winston Churchill too might be among the resilient. He once said, ‘Success consists of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasm.’ Apparently the ability to reframe failure as part of a larger process— learning, say—is instrumental in being able to cope with it.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, well, that’s Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWant to Optimize your Courage Quotient?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe willing to fail.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, reframe your past failures as fantastic learning opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen get out there and give us all the Wisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love you got.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTODAY.\u003c/p\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"65:T871,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003cp\u003eIn his classic book on \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/creativity-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCreativity\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u003c/a\u003e walks us through the science of what makes extraordinary creators so extraordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, one of the key facets of being a truly great creator is the willingness and ability to FOCUS your attention, eliminating distractions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Csikszentmihalyi puts it: “It is practically impossible to learn a domain deeply enough to make a change in it without dedicating all of one’s attention to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the process of giving their craft THAT much attention, some of the best creators out there might look a little weird.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, Csikszentmihalyi tells us about Albert Einstein.
