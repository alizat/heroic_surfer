If you’re interested in seeing what a yogi who inspired Steve Jobs has to say about success, I think you might enjoy the book as much as I did.","title":"How to Be a Success","pnSubtitle":"The Wisdom of Yogananda","slug":"how-to-be-a-success","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","authorDetails":[{"__typename":"Author","id":"3546326","slug":"paramhansa-yogananda","authorName":"Paramahansa Yogananda","imageUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/paramhansa-yogananda.jpg","tagline":"The Father of Yoga in the West.","contentType":"AUTHOR"}],"coverImage":"https://assets.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/book-covers/how-to-be-a-success-cover.png","contentType":"PHILOSOPHERNOTE","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PhilosopherNote","id":"3606327","intro":"This is our fifth Note on Darrin Donnelly and the fifth of six books from his \"Sports for the Soul\" series.

He called them the “Dreamer” and the “Doer.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore on that in a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, a little more context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe essence of \u003cem\u003eComing Alive\u003c/em\u003e is the fact that there’s an eternal battle going on within you between the best version of you and the not-so-great version of you. Barry and Phil came up with a name for that part of us that’s constantly getting in the way. They call it “Part X.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart X is the voice that’s constantly telling you what’s impossible. “No, you can’t fulfill that dream. Or that one. Nope, can’t break that habit or build that one.” Etc. Etc. Etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, one of the best ways to deal with Part X is to get really good at doing the little things really well. And, to STOP doing the little *bad* things you know aren’t good for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarry says that, although we might not see the connection, self-restraint is what creates true confidence. For a couple reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, if you don’t have self-restraint and you allow yourself to get carried away by every impulse you have, you never know when your life is going to go off the rails. (Right?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, if you don’t have the self-mastery to do what you say is important, you never know if you’ll actually follow through on the big dreams you have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s where the Dreamer and the Doer come in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour Dreamer is the version of you that can see your infinite potential. It KNOWS you can do so much more than you’re currently doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour Doer is the part of you that actually DOES the things that are best for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the deal: Your Dreamer needs to be able to trust your Doer. Your Dreamer needs to know that when it says X, Y, and Z are important that your Doer will actually rock it. If you don’t have that trust in your Doer, you won’t have the confidence you need to rock it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, for the 100th time: Remember: The Latin root of the word \u003cem\u003econfidence\u003c/em\u003e literally means “intense trust.” In this case, we’re talking about trust between your Dreamer and your Doer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1.

In fact, it was a pretty good chunk of cash. According to Wikipedia, a talent was worth about 6,000 \u003cem\u003edenarii\u003c/em\u003e. A denarius was the usual wage for a day’s labor. So, a talent was worth about 20 YEARS worth of work.

Much like any noble purpose, a calling is both meaningful to the self and important to the world beyond the self.

Daimon is a Greek word. The equivalent term in Latin is genius.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBoth words refer to an inhering spirit. We are born, each of us (says James Hillman) with our own individual daimon. The daimon is our guardian. It knows our destiny. It kens our calling. James Hillman makes an analogy to an acorn. The totality of the full-grown oak is contained— every leaf and every branch—already within the acorn.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve always loved that acorn-to-oak tree metaphor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, one of my ALL-TIME favorite wisdom gems is this James Allen’s line from \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/as-a-man-thinketh-james-allen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs a Man Thinketh\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e where he tells us:\u003cem\u003e “The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg; and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until the other day that I actually SAW the power of those acorns in action.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuick context: We’re moving. As part of that move, we got our Ojai house ready to sell. As part of that, we cleaned up the backyard, put some new mulch down, did a little landscaping, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we didn’t spend much time back there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast-forward a few weeks. I’m cruising around yanking out some weeds and what do I see?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral DOZEN micro oak trees sprouting up!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA neighbor’s oak tree kinda hangs over the wall. It’s always dropping acorns but they never fell on soil ready to receive them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut when they did…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo parts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst: What are YOUR dreams? What’s your destiny?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s quiet down long enough to pay attention to our guiding spirits as we soak our acorns in that James Allen wisdom again:\u003cem\u003e “The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg; and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond: Are you giving \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/entelechy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eyour inner intelligence\u003c/a\u003e a chance to sprout and express your fullest potential?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s bring Rollo May in to help us understand how to do THAT with yet another acorn metaphor. He tells us: \u003cem\u003e“The acorn becomes an oak by means of automatic growth; no commitment is necessary. The kitten similarly becomes a cat on the basis of instinct. Nature and being are identical in creatures like them. But a man or woman becomes fully human only by his or her choices and his or her commitment to them. People attain worth and dignity by the multitude of decisions they make from day by day. These decisions require courage.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s to tending the seeds of our potential and remembering that, ultimately, our power is only expressed through courageous decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen shall we make them?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI say: TODAY.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"the-oak-sleeps-in-the-acorn","title":"The Oak Sleeps in the Acorn","subtitle":"Sprouting Genius Work","videoThumbnail":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/videos/thumbnails/original/Optimize-01192-the-oak-sleeps-in-the-acorn-thumb.jpg","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PhilosopherNote","id":"30812","intro":"I’m not sure how I found this book but I’m glad I did!

<div class="line-clamp-2">Joseph Campbell was an American author and teacher best known for his work in the field of comparative mythology. If you’ve ever heard of the “Hero’s Journey,” you have him and his lifelong commitment to studying mythology to thank. This book (written in 1949) is the one that captures the essence of his thoughts on the “monomyth” that shows up across all cultures. One universal hero. A thousand faces. Big Ideas we explore include: a quick look at the hero’s journey, moving past the veil of the unknown (aka romancing your discomfort zone) while creating micro hero journeys (all day every day), your ultimate boon (don’t make King Midas’s mistake), the mistake that the makers of legend made (growth mindset, guys!!), and a portrait of the modern hero (look in the mirror!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Ah, The Power of Myth. This book is based on the amazing PBS interview series Bill Moyers did with Campbell shortly before he passed away and captures some of the 24 hours of filmed wisdom that hit the cutting floor. We'll learn how Campbell came up with the admonition to "follow your bliss!" (hint: it's from the Upanishads), the importance of loving our fate, how we're helped by hidden hands when we really commit to our paths and so much more.</div>

This is a thoughtful and thought-provoking book that challenges the “new science of morality”’s view that morality is essentially biologically and socially determined. Damon and Colby argue that we all have the power to cultivate our more noble, moral possibilities.

<div class="line-clamp-2">In today’s world, the road to character has a much less defined map than the road to external success. In this thoughtful, penetrating book, New York Times op-ed columnist and author David Brooks walks us through the evolution of our culture away from a character ethic toward a society all about what he calls the “Big Me.” And, of course, he shows us the way back to character. Big Ideas we explore include résumé virtues vs. eulogy virtues, answering the summons, conquering yourself, living for holiness and becoming strongest at your weakest point.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">David Brooks is one of the nations’ leading writers and commentators. He is an op-ed columnist for the New York Times and appears regularly on PBS NewsHour and Meet the Press. I loved his book The Road to Character. I loved this one even more. David tells us there are two mountains: The first mountain? That’s what society tells us we should pursue: all the normal trappings of success. The second mountain? That’s where the magic (and joy!) exists: where we move beyond ourselves and COMMIT (important word for this book!) to giving ourselves most fully to something bigger than ourselves. David identifies four potential commitments: to our families, to our vocations, to our faith/philosophy of life and to our communities. Ultimately, the book is intended to be a guide to the ULTIMATE quest in life: “The Quest for a Moral Life.”</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Alexandra got this book for me after I told her how much I loved David Brooks’ The Second Mountain. Apparently it is recommended alongside that book on Amazon. With 1,400+ reviews, Alexandra thought I might like it. Not only did I like the book, I loved it. And, I fell in love with Richard Rohr. Father Rohr is a Franciscan priest who beautifully integrates his faith with wisdom from various perspectives. Big Ideas we explore include our main Job in life (remembering that we're light bulbs and staying screwed in!), life's two major tasks, the fact that the way UP is DOWN (hence, the title of the book: Falling Upward), the hero and the heroine and their journeys, the paradox of the ego ("You ironically need a very strong ego structure to let go of your ego"), and how to become a Serene Disciple (let God drive).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">As you know if you’ve been following along, I love Abraham Maslow and feel a deep kinship to him and his work. We have featured two of the books he published during his lifetime: Toward a Psychology of Being and Motivation and Personality. Although this book has only ONE review on Amazon and I could only buy a used copy of it, I knew I’d love it. And, although I had already been deeply influenced by Maslow and his thinking, there was something about reading his unpublished essays and journal thoughts that made me feel that much more connected to this great man. Big Ideas we explore include Maslow’s thoughts on the “eupsychian ideal” (aka: the “eudaemonic ideal”!), the psychology of happiness (eudaimonology!!), Stoic philosophy (Maslow was a fan), vicious cultural influences (Maslow was NOT a fan!), and the Jonah Complex (ANSWER YOUR HEROIC CALL, already!!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our sixth (!) Note on one of Tom Morris's books. As you know if you’ve been following, Tom Morris is one of my all-time favorite authors and at least tied for first as my favorite living philosopher. In this book, Professor Morris challenges us to reconsider what it means to be a citizen and an “everyday patriot” in the modern world—committed to upholding the virtues of our highest ideals in our everyday lives. I’m excited to explore a handful of my favorite Big Ideas, so let's jump straight in.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our second Note on one of Yogananda’s books. This book is a collection of articles that appeared in Yogananda’s magazines in the 1920s and 1930s. Yogananda reminds me of an Indian, often more spiritual version of old-school Western teachers like Orison Swett Marden, James Allen, Ernest Holmes, Dale Carnegie, and Napoleon Hill. If you’re interested in seeing what a yogi who inspired Steve Jobs has to say about success, I think you might enjoy the book as much as I did.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fifth Note on Darrin Donnelly and the fifth of six books from his "Sports for the Soul" series. We'll be featuring the entire series. This book is a fable about a high school coach who’s doubting whether he made the right decision to stay in the small town in which he grew up and coach the same football team his father coached for decades. The most important theme: Follow your heart. Trust yourself and your authentic path. Do what YOU are here to do. Do YOUR duty. Play YOUR role as well as you can. THAT is what it means to be truly Heroic. And, that’s what this book is all about. I’m excited to share a few of my favorite Big Ideas so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">The Last Lecture is an inspiring handbook for life written as a follow-up to a viral talk by Randy Pausch. Randy was a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When it became terminal, he gave his “last lecture.” The talk was recorded. It went viral. And this book was written with Jeffrey Zaslow as a follow-up. Over 20 million people have now watched that talk and, if you’re one of them, you know just how magnetically inspiring Randy is. The book features fifty-three micro chapters—each telling a different story from Randy’s life. It’s packed with wisdom and I’m excited to share some of my favorite Big Ideas so let’s jump straight in!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Welcome to the Philosopher’s Note on our Heroic Coach invitation letter. Although people have told me I need to do a Note on my own book when it comes out (planning to!), this is the first Note I’ve done on my own work. (Hah!) We figured it would be fun to QUICKLY capture the power of our Heroic Coach program in the context of a Philosopher’s Note. So... Here we are. The letter is, essentially, an invitation to join our scientifically-validated 300-day program to learn how to activate your Heroic potential WHILE learning how to empower *others* to do the same so we can change the world together—starting with you and me and all of us—TODAY. In the letter, I make the VERY important distinction that, whether or not you *think* you are a “coach” ... you are. I’m excited to share exactly what the 300-day program is all about and WHY it has been so transformative for so many people, so let’s jump straight in!</div>

She recommended some books and told me that I’d LOVE Eric and his wisdom.
Thanks, Miata! You were right! :)
Eric Thomas is a FASCINATING human being.
As per his bio on the back flap, he is “part coach, part preacher, all grind.”
He’s one of the world’s best-known motivational speakers. Better known as ET, he’s inspired millions of people with his creative style and high-energy messages.
His raw authenticity is incredibly compelling and this book is fantastic. (Get a copy .)

<p class="!pb-0">by<!-- --> <span><a class="font-normal text-red transition-colors hover:text-red-700" href="/authors/arnold-schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a></span></p>
<div class="line-clamp-2">Arnold Schwarzenegger is a FASCINATING human being and this is a fantastic book. I basically read it in one sitting one fine Sunday in between supporting Emerson during one of his recent chess tournaments. I watched Arnold’s inspiring documentary on Netflix so when I saw he released this book, I immediately got it, read it, and here we are. I highly recommend the book. Unless you’ve been in seclusion in the Himalayas for the last fifty years, you know who Arnold Schwarzenegger is. The young Arnold dominated the bodybuilding world then he became a leading man in Hollywood before serving for eight years as California’s 38th governor. In this book, he tells us about the seven tools he encourages us to use to create a life of deep meaning and purpose and to, in short... BE USEFUL. The book is packed with Big Ideas. I’m excited to share some of my favorites so let’s get to work.</div>

<p class="!pb-0">by<!-- --> <span><a class="font-normal text-red transition-colors hover:text-red-700" href="/authors/tom-rath">Tom Rath</a></span></p>
<div class="line-clamp-2">I’m a big fan of Tom Rath and his work. And... I’m not alone. His 10 books have sold over 10 million copies. Dan Pink (author of Drive and When) calls him “One of the most successful nonfiction writers of his generation.” We featured two of his earlier books: Eat Move Sleep and Are You Fully Charged? Plus: His children’s book called The Rechargeables remains one of my all-time favorites. “Life’s Great Question” that beckons all of us (“What can I contribute?”) is beautifully framed by the Martin Luther King, Jr. quote that kicks off the book: “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?” This book is a field manual to help us go about answering that question so we can, as per the subtitle of the book: “Discover How You Contribute to the World.” Big Ideas we explore include creating a sense of urgency in life, Purpose 2.0, connecting what we do to those we serve, undivided attention (our new secret weapon), and creating the energy to be our best.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Dan Millman is one of my favorite teachers and deepest inspirations. This is a super concise, quick-reading book (150 pages) in which Dan synthesizes wisdom from many of his other books—shining light on how we can engage in the four purposes of life to create meaning in an ever-changing world. Big Ideas we explore include a quick look at the 4 purposes of life, the fact that daily life is your master teacher, the required classes in the school of life (and how you’re graded), the importance of deciding to decide (then going all in), how to live happily ever after, and making every moment extraordinary.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Black holes. Just contemplating the sheer, fierce power of them is awe-inspiring, eh? Isaiah Hankel tells us that although physicists used to think that everything got destroyed in a black hole, now they believe that it’s less about destruction and more about *transformation.* And shines some light on the power of focusing on our purpose with black hole intensity. Big Ideas we explore include sheep vs. strategists, figuring out your ikigai (= why you get up in the morning), the fascinating endurance of rats with hope, the first two steps in greatness and moving from vision to decision.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Dan Pink is an incredibly engaging writer and this book is fantastic. In this book, he tackles human motivation and, as the sub-title suggests, tells us “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.” Here’s his Twitter summary: “Carrots &amp; sticks are so last century. Drive says for 21st century work, we need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery &amp; purpose.” Big Ideas we explore include understanding Motivation 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 along w/ how to upgrade our operating system, why Autonomy is so important, The Three Laws of Mastery and discovering our Purpose via a big question and a small one.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jean-Paul Sartre was a French philosopher, novelist, playwright, and critic. He was a leading intellectual of the 20th century and the leading proponent of existentialism. This short book is a transcript of a speech Sartre gave in 1945 to address many of the critics of existentialism. It’s a *remarkably* lucid, concise exposition on the primary tenets of existentialism—even more remarkable given the fact that Sartre gave this lecture without notes. Big Ideas we explore: Anguish + its antidote, passion vs. choice, quietism vs. commitment, the stern optimism of existentialism and moral choices as a work of art.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Welcome to the final installment of the magical Harry Potter series. I can’t believe how quickly Emerson and I tore through all of them—particularly this one. We begin with the seven Potters escaping the Dursley’s home, immediately getting ambushed by awaiting Death Eaters. And the thrills never cease. We lose our heroes Mad Eye Moody and Dobby. Celebrate Lupin and Tonks’ wedding and baby boy, meet the mysterious silver doe Patronus, break into Gringotts and track down the secrets of the Peverall brothers and their Deathly Hallows. Big Ideas we explore include the hero’s gift, follow your instincts, the bodhisattvic hero’s boon, and dedicating our lives to the greater good.</div>

It’s based on a training program he created called The Psychology of Achievement that he taught to 1 million+ people. It’s a dense, 350-page encyclopedia of Big Ideas to help us jumbo crush it. Big Ideas we explore: the 7 ingredients of success, the Law of Substitution, mining your acres of diamonds, 7 questions that can change your life, moving from positive thinking to positive knowing, treating excusitis, and the secret sauce of achievement (hint: it’s love).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Written in 1859, this is one of the classics of self-development. Smiles focuses on character development, hard work and perseverance rather than the get-it-quick-fluff found in so much of modern self-dev. In the Note, we’ll explore a bunch of Big Ideas including the power of diligence and how to make happiness a habit!</div>

In the Note, we explore some of my favorites—including an awesome exercise on how to discover our purpose, the importance of taking responsibility in our lives (that's Principle #1!!!), becoming an inverse paranoid (think: “OMG the universe is out to help me!!”), and recognizing that 99% commitment to something is a bitch and 100% is a breeze.</div>

He called them the “Dreamer” and the “Doer.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore on that in a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, a little more context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe essence of \u003cem\u003eComing Alive\u003c/em\u003e is the fact that there’s an eternal battle going on within you between the best version of you and the not-so-great version of you. Barry and Phil came up with a name for that part of us that’s constantly getting in the way. They call it “Part X.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart X is the voice that’s constantly telling you what’s impossible. “No, you can’t fulfill that dream. Or that one. Nope, can’t break that habit or build that one.” Etc. Etc. Etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, one of the best ways to deal with Part X is to get really good at doing the little things really well. And, to STOP doing the little *bad* things you know aren’t good for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarry says that, although we might not see the connection, self-restraint is what creates true confidence. For a couple reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, if you don’t have self-restraint and you allow yourself to get carried away by every impulse you have, you never know when your life is going to go off the rails. (Right?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, if you don’t have the self-mastery to do what you say is important, you never know if you’ll actually follow through on the big dreams you have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s where the Dreamer and the Doer come in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour Dreamer is the version of you that can see your infinite potential. It KNOWS you can do so much more than you’re currently doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour Doer is the part of you that actually DOES the things that are best for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the deal: Your Dreamer needs to be able to trust your Doer. Your Dreamer needs to know that when it says X, Y, and Z are important that your Doer will actually rock it. If you don’t have that trust in your Doer, you won’t have the confidence you need to rock it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, for the 100th time: Remember: The Latin root of the word \u003cem\u003econfidence\u003c/em\u003e literally means “intense trust.” In this case, we’re talking about trust between your Dreamer and your Doer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1. Here’s the way Barry tells us to operationalize that wisdom: At every choice point today (yes, EVERY), ask your Doer if he thinks the Dreamer will appreciate what you’re about to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoment to moment to moment.

Much like any noble purpose, a calling is both meaningful to the self and important to the world beyond the self. Christian theologian Frederick Buechner writes, ‘The kind of work God usually calls you to do is the kind of work (a) that you need most to do and (b) that the world most needs to have done. . . .
