And bet on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s scientifically-validated wisdom in Henry Ford’s quip that whether we think we can or think we can’t, we’re right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, Part I reflections: What’s your #1 goal right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGot it?

Where’s your self-efficacy on a scale of 1 to 10?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWherever it is, let’s Optimize it with the four primary ways Bandura tells us we can build self-efficacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eMastery Experience.\u003c/strong\u003e In other words, PAST SUCCESS. Small and big wins from the past are GREAT ways to boost your current confidence. Create those wins, feast on them as you build your self-image as someone who succeeds (“That’s like me!!), and bring those past mastery experiences to mind when you’re facing current challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eVicarious Learning.\u003c/strong\u003e In other words, seeing \u003cem\u003esomeone else\u003c/em\u003e achieve the success YOU would like to achieve. Basic idea here: If \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e can do it, YOU can do it. KNOW that. (Note: DO NOT get \u003cem\u003eenvious\u003c/em\u003e of their success. Celebrate it. And say, “If they can do it, I can do it.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eSocial Persuasion.\u003c/strong\u003e In other words, someone \u003cem\u003etells\u003c/em\u003e you that you can achieve success. Like a coach. Or supportive parent or friend. Or ME. (Hah.) “YOU’VE GOT THIS!!!” You can also persuade \u003cem\u003eyourself\u003c/em\u003e through positive self-talk and an antifragile, confident mindset. (And, remember to be the one persuading \u003cem\u003eothers\u003c/em\u003e of their potential!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4. \u003cstrong\u003ePhysiology.\u003c/strong\u003e In other words, if you want to succeed, ACT like a successful person. Walk, talk, breathe, and carry yourself as if you’ve already achieved that which you aspire to achieve. Presence-101 style. Strike a power pose and go rock it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… We have the Big 4 of Self-Efficacy: \u003cstrong\u003eMastery Experiences\u003c/strong\u003e + \u003cstrong\u003eVicarious Learning\u003c/strong\u003e + \u003cstrong\u003eSocial Persuasion\u003c/strong\u003e + \u003cstrong\u003ePhysiology\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow’re YOU doing with each?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4 quick questions:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1.

He split them into a couple groups. One group was given shocks but they could figure out how to avoid them easily. The other group was given random shocks that they couldn’t avoid.

Some of them, even after being bombarded with “shocks” maintain an empowered response. Seligman wanted to understand what made THEM tick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe distilled the essence of what he learned into another one of his great books called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/learned-optimism-martin-seligman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearned Optimism\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

Professor Jerome Singer has been studying the subject for FIFTY years! Let’s take a super-quick look at the \u003cem\u003ethree\u003c/em\u003e primary styles of daydreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, you might just have “poor attention control”—and have a difficult time focusing on *anything* (including your daydreaming!). That’s obviously not ideal. Ideally, we’d be able to focus our attention at will and then let it go at will. (Enter: Less \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/multitasking-is-a-myth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003etask switching\u003c/a\u003e plus Meditation 101 and other attention-muscle-building exercises!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have “guilty-dysphoric.” When mind-wandering is “dysphoric,” our thoughts drift to some negative places that aren’t positive or productive. Perhaps we ruminate on things and drive ourselves a little nutty in the process. Again, sub-optimal. We want to notice this and \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/rumination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003espit our cuds as per this +1\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, finally, we have “positive-constructive” daydreaming. THIS, of course, is where we want to spend our time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Manoush says: \u003cem\u003e“The flip side of dysphoric daydreaming, the positive-constructive kind, is when our thoughts veer toward the imaginative. We get excited about the possibilities that our brain can conjure up seemingly out of nowhere, like magic. This mode of mind-wandering reflects our internal drive to explore ideas and feelings, make plans, and problem solve.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;- THAT’s the healthy default mode.

Practical wisdom allows us to make decisions that improve our eudaimonia, the (ethically) good life. Courage can be physical, but more broadly refers to the moral aspect—for instance, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances… Temperance makes it possible for us to control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to excesses. Justice, for Socrates and the Stoics, refers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: That’s from Part II of the book: “How to Behave in the World.” The short answer on how to behave?

Interestingly, though, there is much more convergence than we would expect in these days when cultural relativism is so often portrayed as the norm. A study by Katherine Dahlsgaard, Christopher Peterson, and Martin Seligman looked at how virtue is articulated in Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, and what they call ‘Athenian philosophy’ (mostly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). They found a rather surprising amount of congruence among all of these religious-philosophical traditions and identified a set of six ‘core’ virtues: Courage, Justice, Humanity, Temperance, Wisdom, and Transcendence.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFour of the six are indistinguishable from the Stoic virtues. Stoics also accepted the importance of ‘humanity’ and ‘transcendence,’ although they didn’t think of these as virtues, but rather as attitudes toward others (humanity) and toward the universe at large (transcendence).”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap and drop it into our Heroic framework.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Stoics had their four cardinal virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice. Modern scientists looked across a range of religious-philosophical doctrines across a range of cultures and found the same four virtues and added two: Humanity + Transcendence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think we can all agree that Wisdom + Courage + Temperance (or, as I prefer, Self-Mastery) are essential. Then, as we briefly discussed in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/musonius-rufus-musonius-rufus-cynthia-arrieu-king-william-irvine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eNote on Musonius Rufus\u003c/a\u003e, I think “Justice” is a very weak word to capture the LOVE the Stoics (and all other traditions) encouraged us to feel for their families, communities and world. So, why not just call the fourth virtue “Love”? Then we can throw the scientist’s “Justice” and “Humanity” under that umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow we have Wisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo run it through our Heroic model: We start by having Wisdom. We know the game we’re playing (eudaimonia!) AND, very importantly, how to play it well (operationalize virtue!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we cultivate our Self-Mastery (with an emphasis on the fundamentals so we can Optimize our Energy). Why? So we can more consistently live with both Courage (in all aspects of our lives but with an emphasis on Work) and so we can more consistently live with Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we do the hard work of operationalizing virtue, we make progress in closing the gap between who we are \u003cem\u003ecapable\u003c/em\u003e of being and who we are \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e being—more and more consistently living with eudaimonia and expressing the Optimus-best version of ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat leads us to Transcendence. From my vantage point, the eudaimonically-best version of ourselves naturally (almost \u003cem\u003eeffervescently\u003c/em\u003e) transcends self-interest and lives a life committed to more than just themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Greek word for that? Hērōs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe become modern, everyday “protectors” of our families and communities and world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have strength for two. We give the world all we’ve got.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S.

Gratitude has one of the strongest links to mental health and satisfaction with life of any personality trait—more so than even optimism, hope, or compassion. Grateful people experience higher levels of positive emotions such as joy, enthusiasm, love, happiness, and optimism, and gratitude as a discipline protects us from the destructive impulses of envy, resentment, greed, and bitterness. People who experience gratitude can cope more effectively with everyday stress, show increased resilience in the face of trauma-induced stress, recover more quickly from illness, and enjoy more robust physical health. Many of these effects are quantifiable. Consider these eye-popping statistics. People are 25 percent happier if they keep gratitude journals, sleep one-half hour more per evening, and exercise 33 percent more each week compared to persons who are not keeping these journals. … Experiencing gratitude leads to increased feelings of connectedness, improved relationships, and even altruism.

As one of the most famous experiments in positive psychology, the following study remains legendary in demonstrating the potential effects of positive emotions on longevity. Nuns are the epitome of healthy living, and as they have very controlled lifestyles, this makes for ideal research participants. As part of a larger study, researchers at the University of Kentucky decided to retrospectively review and analyze the entry statements of newly appointed nuns (mean age 22 at time of entry). By 85, 97 per cent of the nuns whose entries contained the most positive wording and emotional content were still alive (vs. 52 per cent of the least positive). And similarly, at 93, 52 per cent of the cheerful entrants were still alive versus 18 per cent of the least cheerful. Thus, researchers suggest that being happy could actually add up to 10 years to your life. In order to extend the findings into other autobiographical works Sarah Pressman analyzed the autobiographies of 96 famous psychologists and found that those who used more positive emotive wording lived on average six years longer than those who used more negative emotive words.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow fascinating is THAT study?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe quick recap: Nuns check in for service.

It may also cause us to forgo adoption of medical advice and treatment. Overall, the ‘cult of optimism’ and tyranny of positive thinking must not go unheeded.

They may struggle for many years with considerable psychological pain. The new psychology of posttraumatic growth does not deny this fact but, rather, simply recognizes that there is another side to the coin—that in the midst of great psychological pain there can also be a new recognition of one’s personal qualities and a deeper and more satisfying connection to others.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThree existential themes are at the core of posttraumatic growth. The first is the recognition that life is uncertain and that things change. This amounts to a tolerance of uncertainty that, in turn, reflects the ability to embrace it as a fundamental tenet of human existence. The second is psychological mindfulness, which reflects self-awareness and an understanding of how one’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are related to each other as well as a flexible attitude toward personal change. The third is acknowledgment of personal agency, which entails a sense of responsibility for the choices one makes in life and an awareness that choices have consequences.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePosttraumatic growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVery importantly, it doesn’t deny the fact that trauma can create considerable psychological stress and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStephen tells us that the stress is like an “engine” for growth. The challenge is to make sure the engine doesn’t overheat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs he says, \u003cem\u003e“But the diagnosis of PTSD does not describe a lifelong condition. It describes a set of problems that a person experiences at a specific point in his or her life—one that, when understood properly, can be the engine of posttraumatic growth. But this ‘engine’ can overheat. And, when it does, we need to stop and check the radiator, thermostat, pump, and antifreeze. The point I’m making metaphorically here is that, when confronted by adversity, we need to actively search for new emotion-regulation and self-soothing strategies so as to get ourselves running smoothly again.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike so many other things we’ve discussed, stress following trauma tends to follow an inverted U. Too little stress and there isn’t much growth. Too MUCH stress and we run the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder rather than posttraumatic growth. It’s right in the middle of that inverted U where we find the optimal level of stress that leads to growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHelping us understand this point theoretically and then implement the wisdom practically is, of course, what the book is all about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s take a quick look at the three existential themes at the core of posttraumatic growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, we need to be willing to embrace the uncertainty that is inherently part of life. We run the risk of being unnecessarily fragile if we don’t allow room for the inevitable (!) obstacles and challenges and even traumas to be a part of a deeply meaningful life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Abraham Maslow once said about the self-actualizers he studied: \u003cem\u003e“the most important learning experiences . . . were tragedies, deaths, and trauma . . . which forced change in the life-outlook of the person and consequently in everything they did.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, that doesn’t mean that we are expected to \u003cem\u003eenjoy\u003c/em\u003e those tragedies per se. But, when we allow for the presence of these tough times, we are more likely to find that optimal growth point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, we need to practice psychological mindfulness. We want to cultivate self-awareness and notice of how our thoughts, emotions and behaviors are related to each other while we cultivate a flexible attitude toward change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, third, we need a sense of “agency”—a belief that we have what it takes to meet those inevitable challenges life throws our way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of my favorite books on the subject is called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-power-of-agency-paul-napper-anthony-rao-ph-d/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Power of Agency\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. In our Notes we reflect on wisdom from Paul Napper and Anthony Rao who tell us: \u003cem\u003e“When we set out to write this book, we were struck by one thing above all. We observed the link between people’s general confidence and their ability to meet significant challenges. It seemed that those who were confident more of the time–that is, they were feeling more in charge of their lives and connected to their sense of agency–reported less anxiety and overwhelm, even when they were placed under highly challenging pressure situations.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor us, this was a eureka moment. It wasn’t just that less anxious people felt more confident but that confidence itself fended off anxiety and moments of overwhelm.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere is a biological parallel here. The sympathetic nervous system (which ignites fear and aggression when the brain perceives threat) and the parasympathetic nervous system (which returns the mind and body to calm and homeostasis) work in this seesaw way.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe breakthrough idea we had is this: instead of trying to lower people’s worry or anxiousness (as many practitioners now do with pills and therapies), we attack it from the other end. We encourage a confidence that can actually help keep stress away. And we do it by figuring out what empowers people, what gives people greater capacity to cope and adapt, and nurturing that. Our theory was that the resulting confidence would neutralize–or at least keep at bay–the negative emotions that so often drag people down.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s to practicing our tolerance of uncertainty, psychological mindfulness and sense of agency with the little things TODAY so we can more powerfully use stress as fuel for our growth for the rest of our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e+1. +1. +1.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"what-doesnt-kill-us","title":"What Doesn’t Kill Us","subtitle":"The New Psychology of Posttraumatic Growth","videoThumbnail":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/videos/thumbnails/original/Optimize-01167-what-doesnt-kill-us-thumb.jpg","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PlusOne","id":"36355","authorizationState":"AUTHORIZEDUSER","contentType":"PLUSONE","audioUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/downloads/mp3s/files/Optimize-01175-sugar-depression.mp3","number":1175,"intro":"Continuing our brief tour through Kate Hefferon’s textbook on Positive Psychology and the Body, let’s flip open to the chapter on","content":"\u003cp\u003eContinuing our brief tour through Kate Hefferon’s textbook on \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/positive-psychology-and-the-body-kate-hefferon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePositive Psychology and the Body\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, let’s flip open to the chapter on “Positive Nutrition.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHmmmm…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wonder what science has to say about the impact of our diets on our wellbeing…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuess where Kate starts her discussion?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith sugar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe tells us: \u003cem\u003e“Sugar has been a component within western diets since the sixteenth century.

(Hah!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, eventually, Jonah accepts his fate and does what he’s here’s to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott talks about this in a chapter on “Self-Esteem” in which he walks us through a nuanced discussion about what healthy ambition (and pride) looks like vis-a-vis the less healthy expression of ambition and pride that shows up in what psychologists call “vulnerable” and “grandiose narcissism.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll save that important, nuanced discussion for another time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, here’s how Scott frames it in \u003cem\u003eTranscend\u003c/em\u003e: \u003cem\u003e“Maslow argued that in order to avoid punishment from society, the person ‘becomes humble, ingratiating, appeasing, even masochistic. In short, due to fear of punishment for being superior, she becomes inferior and throws away some of her possibilities for humanness. For the sake of safety and security, she cripples and stunts herself. . . . That is, she is evading the task for which she was born, so to speak. She is evading her destiny.’ Maslow refers to this as the ‘Jonah Complex,’ a phenomenon described by the historian Frank Manuel. This phrase is based on the biblical tale of Jonah who, out of fear, tries to run from God’s prophecy, but he can find no place to hide. Finally, accepting his fate, he does what he is called to do.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe continues by saying: \u003cem\u003e“So let me state this as clearly as possible: you may not be entitled to shine, but you have a right to shine, because you are a worthy human being. Changing your self-limiting narratives about your worthiness, asserting needs in a healthy way, overcoming your avoidance of fearful experiences, and taking responsibility for your behaviors—these actions strengthen and stabilize the vulnerable self. The great irony is that the less you focus on whether you are worthy and competent, and take that as a given, the greater the chances you will consistently accept your inherent worth.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you being called by God or whatever you call that power that’s bigger than you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf yes, are you answering the call?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf not, are you quieting down long enough to hear that quiet voice?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you’ve probably picked up by now 😉, I believe we are ALL being called to shine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s humbly yet powerfully answer that call as we overcome our avoidance of fearful experiences, take responsibility for our behaviors and take it as a given that we are worthy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen go give our families, communities, and the world all we’ve got.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow about TODAY.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"the-jonah-complex","title":"The Jonah Complex","subtitle":"Quit Running from Your Destiny","videoThumbnail":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/videos/thumbnails/original/Optimize-01255-the-jonah-complex-thumb.jpg","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PlusOne","id":"36563","authorizationState":"AUTHORIZEDUSER","contentType":"PLUSONE","audioUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/downloads/mp3s/files/Optimize-01278-maslow-on-glumness-and-grimness.mp3","number":1278,"intro":"Abraham Maslow is one of my absolute favorite teachers and thinkers and heroes.

In fact, it has just a single rating on Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s phenomenal. I enjoyed a couple of Maslow’s published works including \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/motivation-and-personality-abraham-maslow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMotivation and Personality\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/toward-a-psychology-of-being-abraham-maslow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eToward a Psychology of Being\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Those are incredible books. Check out the Notes, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was something about these notes to himself and other unpublished writings that revealed the depths of his thinking and his humanity. It felt like hanging out with a dear friend or beloved mentor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which brings us one step closer to what I want to discuss Today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuick context: Maslow once gave a talk at the University of Maine in August of 1966. He started the talk by saying, \u003cem\u003e“I changed my plans this morning.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose are LITERALLY the first words of his talk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he goes on to say that he originally planned to give a more traditional talk on what they expected him to talk about but, he says, \u003cem\u003e“I decided to alter my plans and to present something with which I am currently struggling—partly because it harbors great interest for the fields of counseling and psychotherapy and partly because it involves a fleshing-out of a whole, new, humanistic, and transhumanistic conception of human beings.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe then says: \u003cem\u003e“I do not have any notes with me, yet I am willing to try. I also confess that I am a little shy and timorous with the topic. Then, it occurred to me that this shyness has been a characteristic feature of my own intellectual work: Whenever something new pops into my consciousness, I initially fight it. In the psychoanalytic sense, I experience resistance often involving just plain fear.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he tells us: \u003cem\u003e“I develop insomnia, cold chills, even poor digestion. Yet, I also feel a kind of pride, as though I am wrestling with something strong. And slowly, it dawns on me that something is cooking intellectually inside. So by now, at the age of nearly 60, I know that if I begin to suffer from insomnia, digestive problems, glumness, and grimness, it is actually a good sign. My wife will aptly comment: ‘Something good is cooking, isn’t it, Abe?’”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, he says: “I am just at the point of developing a new theory, and I’m not quite courageous enough to fully accept its implications. It almost frightens me. I am scared of what it may mean in overturning mainstream psychological notions, and it rouses a whole conflict of pride and humility, hubris and fear. Well, let me try it, and if my voice begins to quiver, you will understand why.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e👆 😲\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what to say about that other than that it moves me on a visceral level. It reminds me of \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/mr-rogers-creative-neighborhood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMister Rogers telling us about the “tortures of the damned” he often endured\u003c/a\u003e to create.

It was created by Martin Seligman and Christopher Peterson who worked with over 50 scientists to create a deeper understanding of the power of character strengths. They also created the VIA Inventory of Strengths test that has been taken by millions of people from around the world.

We have some great Notes on Movement (Spark, Spartan Up and No Sweat among my favorites), but Kelly’s book will be our new go-to for the science of WHY exercise/movement is so essential to our well-being. It’s PHENOMENAL. Reading about the SCIENCE behind stories of transformation (and how, as per the sub-title of her book: “Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage”) also made me that much more clear on the power of what we’re doing with all of our work and the importance of focusing so much on Energy (especially with our Mastery and Coach programs).

He split them into a couple groups. One group was given shocks but they could figure out how to avoid them easily. The other group was given random shocks that they couldn’t avoid. That was the first part of the study.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the second part of the study, the dogs were given a shock again but this time it was super easy for all of them to learn how to avoid the shock.

Some of them, even after being bombarded with “shocks” maintain an empowered response. Seligman wanted to understand what made THEM tick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe distilled the essence of what he learned into another one of his great books called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/learned-optimism-martin-seligman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearned Optimism\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

If you’ve been shocked by life and learned to curl up in a ball, you’ve given up your power and that leads to places we don’t want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution: LEARN OPTIMISM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnter: \u003cstrong\u003eThe 3 P’s of Optimism: Permanence + Pervasiveness + Personalization\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the super quick look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePermanence.\u003c/strong\u003e Let’s say something challenging happens.

Practical wisdom allows us to make decisions that improve our eudaimonia, the (ethically) good life. Courage can be physical, but more broadly refers to the moral aspect—for instance, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances… Temperance makes it possible for us to control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to excesses. Justice, for Socrates and the Stoics, refers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: That’s from Part II of the book: “How to Behave in the World.” The short answer on how to behave?

Interestingly, though, there is much more convergence than we would expect in these days when cultural relativism is so often portrayed as the norm. A study by Katherine Dahlsgaard, Christopher Peterson, and Martin Seligman looked at how virtue is articulated in Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, and what they call ‘Athenian philosophy’ (mostly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). They found a rather surprising amount of congruence among all of these religious-philosophical traditions and identified a set of six ‘core’ virtues: Courage, Justice, Humanity, Temperance, Wisdom, and Transcendence.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFour of the six are indistinguishable from the Stoic virtues.

Gratitude has one of the strongest links to mental health and satisfaction with life of any personality trait—more so than even optimism, hope, or compassion. Grateful people experience higher levels of positive emotions such as joy, enthusiasm, love, happiness, and optimism, and gratitude as a discipline protects us from the destructive impulses of envy, resentment, greed, and bitterness. People who experience gratitude can cope more effectively with everyday stress, show increased resilience in the face of trauma-induced stress, recover more quickly from illness, and enjoy more robust physical health. Many of these effects are quantifiable. Consider these eye-popping statistics. People are 25 percent happier if they keep gratitude journals, sleep one-half hour more per evening, and exercise 33 percent more each week compared to persons who are not keeping these journals. … Experiencing gratitude leads to increased feelings of connectedness, improved relationships, and even altruism.

As one of the most famous experiments in positive psychology, the following study remains legendary in demonstrating the potential effects of positive emotions on longevity. Nuns are the epitome of healthy living, and as they have very controlled lifestyles, this makes for ideal research participants. As part of a larger study, researchers at the University of Kentucky decided to retrospectively review and analyze the entry statements of newly appointed nuns (mean age 22 at time of entry). By 85, 97 per cent of the nuns whose entries contained the most positive wording and emotional content were still alive (vs. 52 per cent of the least positive). And similarly, at 93, 52 per cent of the cheerful entrants were still alive versus 18 per cent of the least cheerful. Thus, researchers suggest that being happy could actually add up to 10 years to your life. In order to extend the findings into other autobiographical works Sarah Pressman analyzed the autobiographies of 96 famous psychologists and found that those who used more positive emotive wording lived on average six years longer than those who used more negative emotive words.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow fascinating is THAT study?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe quick recap: Nuns check in for service.

They may struggle for many years with considerable psychological pain. The new psychology of posttraumatic growth does not deny this fact but, rather, simply recognizes that there is another side to the coin—that in the midst of great psychological pain there can also be a new recognition of one’s personal qualities and a deeper and more satisfying connection to others.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThree existential themes are at the core of posttraumatic growth. The first is the recognition that life is uncertain and that things change. This amounts to a tolerance of uncertainty that, in turn, reflects the ability to embrace it as a fundamental tenet of human existence. The second is psychological mindfulness, which reflects self-awareness and an understanding of how one’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are related to each other as well as a flexible attitude toward personal change. The third is acknowledgment of personal agency, which entails a sense of responsibility for the choices one makes in life and an awareness that choices have consequences.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePosttraumatic growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVery importantly, it doesn’t deny the fact that trauma can create considerable psychological stress and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStephen tells us that the stress is like an “engine” for growth. The challenge is to make sure the engine doesn’t overheat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs he says, \u003cem\u003e“But the diagnosis of PTSD does not describe a lifelong condition. It describes a set of problems that a person experiences at a specific point in his or her life—one that, when understood properly, can be the engine of posttraumatic growth. But this ‘engine’ can overheat. And, when it does, we need to stop and check the radiator, thermostat, pump, and antifreeze. The point I’m making metaphorically here is that, when confronted by adversity, we need to actively search for new emotion-regulation and self-soothing strategies so as to get ourselves running smoothly again.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike so many other things we’ve discussed, stress following trauma tends to follow an inverted U. Too little stress and there isn’t much growth. Too MUCH stress and we run the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder rather than posttraumatic growth. It’s right in the middle of that inverted U where we find the optimal level of stress that leads to growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHelping us understand this point theoretically and then implement the wisdom practically is, of course, what the book is all about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s take a quick look at the three existential themes at the core of posttraumatic growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, we need to be willing to embrace the uncertainty that is inherently part of life. We run the risk of being unnecessarily fragile if we don’t allow room for the inevitable (!) obstacles and challenges and even traumas to be a part of a deeply meaningful life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Abraham Maslow once said about the self-actualizers he studied: \u003cem\u003e“the most important learning experiences . . . were tragedies, deaths, and trauma . . . which forced change in the life-outlook of the person and consequently in everything they did.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, that doesn’t mean that we are expected to \u003cem\u003eenjoy\u003c/em\u003e those tragedies per se. But, when we allow for the presence of these tough times, we are more likely to find that optimal growth point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, we need to practice psychological mindfulness. We want to cultivate self-awareness and notice of how our thoughts, emotions and behaviors are related to each other while we cultivate a flexible attitude toward change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, third, we need a sense of “agency”—a belief that we have what it takes to meet those inevitable challenges life throws our way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of my favorite books on the subject is called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-power-of-agency-paul-napper-anthony-rao-ph-d/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Power of Agency\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. In our Notes we reflect on wisdom from Paul Napper and Anthony Rao who tell us: \u003cem\u003e“When we set out to write this book, we were struck by one thing above all. We observed the link between people’s general confidence and their ability to meet significant challenges. It seemed that those who were confident more of the time–that is, they were feeling more in charge of their lives and connected to their sense of agency–reported less anxiety and overwhelm, even when they were placed under highly challenging pressure situations.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor us, this was a eureka moment. It wasn’t just that less anxious people felt more confident but that confidence itself fended off anxiety and moments of overwhelm.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere is a biological parallel here. The sympathetic nervous system (which ignites fear and aggression when the brain perceives threat) and the parasympathetic nervous system (which returns the mind and body to calm and homeostasis) work in this seesaw way.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe breakthrough idea we had is this: instead of trying to lower people’s worry or anxiousness (as many practitioners now do with pills and therapies), we attack it from the other end. We encourage a confidence that can actually help keep stress away. And we do it by figuring out what empowers people, what gives people greater capacity to cope and adapt, and nurturing that. Our theory was that the resulting confidence would neutralize–or at least keep at bay–the negative emotions that so often drag people down.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s to practicing our tolerance of uncertainty, psychological mindfulness and sense of agency with the little things TODAY so we can more powerfully use stress as fuel for our growth for the rest of our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e+1. +1. +1.\u003c/p\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"68:Tbc2,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003cp\u003eContinuing our brief tour through Kate Hefferon’s textbook on \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/positive-psychology-and-the-body-kate-hefferon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ePositive Psychology and the Body\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, let’s flip open to the chapter on “Positive Nutrition.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHmmmm…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wonder what science has to say about the impact of our diets on our wellbeing…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuess where Kate starts her discussion?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith sugar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe tells us: \u003cem\u003e“Sugar has been a component within western diets since the sixteenth century.

In short, due to fear of punishment for being superior, she becomes inferior and throws away some of her possibilities for humanness. For the sake of safety and security, she cripples and stunts herself. . . . That is, she is evading the task for which she was born, so to speak. She is evading her destiny.’ Maslow refers to this as the ‘Jonah Complex,’ a phenomenon described by the historian Frank Manuel. This phrase is based on the biblical tale of Jonah who, out of fear, tries to run from God’s prophecy, but he can find no place to hide. Finally, accepting his fate, he does what he is called to do.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe continues by saying: \u003cem\u003e“So let me state this as clearly as possible: you may not be entitled to shine, but you have a right to shine, because you are a worthy human being. Changing your self-limiting narratives about your worthiness, asserting needs in a healthy way, overcoming your avoidance of fearful experiences, and taking responsibility for your behaviors—these actions strengthen and stabilize the vulnerable self. The great irony is that the less you focus on whether you are worthy and competent, and take that as a given, the greater the chances you will consistently accept your inherent worth.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s Today’s +1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you being called by God or whatever you call that power that’s bigger than you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf yes, are you answering the call?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf not, are you quieting down long enough to hear that quiet voice?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you’ve probably picked up by now 😉, I believe we are ALL being called to shine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s humbly yet powerfully answer that call as we overcome our avoidance of fearful experiences, take responsibility for our behaviors and take it as a given that we are worthy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen go give our families, communities, and the world all we’ve got.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow about TODAY.\u003c/p\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"6a:T12d2,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/abraham-maslow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAbraham Maslow\u003c/a\u003e is one of my absolute favorite teachers and thinkers and heroes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, he was one of the 20th century’s greatest psychologists who helped shaped the nascent humanistic psychology movement that evolved into the modern positive psychology movement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich is why, when a number of our Heroes recommended it, I immediately bought Scott Barry Kaufman’s latest book called \u003cem\u003eTranscend\u003c/em\u003e—which is all about “The New Science of Self-Actualization.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn THAT book, Scott references a book called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/future-visions-edward-hoffman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFuture Visions\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—which features “The Unpublished Papers of Abraham Maslow.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, of course, I immediately got THAT book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not a popular book.

Check out the Notes, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was something about these notes to himself and other unpublished writings that revealed the depths of his thinking and his humanity. It felt like hanging out with a dear friend or beloved mentor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which brings us one step closer to what I want to discuss Today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuick context: Maslow once gave a talk at the University of Maine in August of 1966. He started the talk by saying, \u003cem\u003e“I changed my plans this morning.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose are LITERALLY the first words of his talk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he goes on to say that he originally planned to give a more traditional talk on what they expected him to talk about but, he says, \u003cem\u003e“I decided to alter my plans and to present something with which I am currently struggling—partly because it harbors great interest for the fields of counseling and psychotherapy and partly because it involves a fleshing-out of a whole, new, humanistic, and transhumanistic conception of human beings.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe then says: \u003cem\u003e“I do not have any notes with me, yet I am willing to try. I also confess that I am a little shy and timorous with the topic. Then, it occurred to me that this shyness has been a characteristic feature of my own intellectual work: Whenever something new pops into my consciousness, I initially fight it. In the psychoanalytic sense, I experience resistance often involving just plain fear.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he tells us: \u003cem\u003e“I develop insomnia, cold chills, even poor digestion. Yet, I also feel a kind of pride, as though I am wrestling with something strong. And slowly, it dawns on me that something is cooking intellectually inside. So by now, at the age of nearly 60, I know that if I begin to suffer from insomnia, digestive problems, glumness, and grimness, it is actually a good sign. My wife will aptly comment: ‘Something good is cooking, isn’t it, Abe?’”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, he says: “I am just at the point of developing a new theory, and I’m not quite courageous enough to fully accept its implications. It almost frightens me. I am scared of what it may mean in overturning mainstream psychological notions, and it rouses a whole conflict of pride and humility, hubris and fear. Well, let me try it, and if my voice begins to quiver, you will understand why.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e👆 😲\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what to say about that other than that it moves me on a visceral level. It reminds me of \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/mr-rogers-creative-neighborhood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMister Rogers telling us about the “tortures of the damned” he often endured\u003c/a\u003e to create.

Big Ideas we explore include the primary difference between Freud and Adler (hint: etiology vs. teleology), the importance of \\\"separating tasks\\\" (aka: stay out of other people's business and don't let them in yours), the ticket to freedom (hint: the courage to be disliked), the center of the world (\u003c- is not you), and Adler's guiding star (happiness defined as contribution!).\",\"title\":\"The Courage to Be Disliked\",\"pnSubtitle\":\"The Japanese Phenomenon That Shows You How to Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness\",\"slug\":\"the-courage-to-be-disliked-ichiro-kishimi-fumitake-koga\",\"authorizationState\":\"FREECONTENT\",\"authorDetails\":[{\"__typename\":\"Author\",\"id\":\"3054\",\"slug\":\"ichiro-kishimi\",\"authorName\":\"Ichiro Kishimi\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/ichiro-kishimi.jpg\",\"tagline\":\"Philosopher, Adlerian psychologist.\",\"contentType\":\"AUTHOR\"},{\"__typename\":\"Author\",\"id\":\"3056\",\"slug\":\"fumitake-koga\",\"authorName\":\"Fumitake Koga\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/fumitake-koga.jpg\",\"tagline\":\"Award-winning professional writer and author.\",\"contentType\":\"AUTHOR\"}],\"coverImage\":\"https://assets.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/book-covers/the-courage-to-be-disliked-cover.png\",\"contentType\":\"PHILOSOPHERNOTE\",\"library\":{\"__typename\":\"Library\",\"saved\":false,\"completed\":false,\"faved\":false}},{\"__typename\":\"PhilosopherNote\",\"id\":\"31847\",\"intro\":\"$3c\",\"title\":\"The Power of Character Strengths\",\"pnSubtitle\":\"Appreciate and Ignite Your Positive Personality\",\"slug\":\"the-power-of-character-strengths-robert-mcgrath-ryan-niemiec\",\"authorizationState\":\"FREECONTENT\",\"authorDetails\":[{\"__typename\":\"Author\",\"id\":\"3134\",\"slug\":\"robert-e-mcgrath\",\"authorName\":\"Robert E.
