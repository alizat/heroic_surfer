But, as he drilled into the scientific literature, he realized just how important Optimizing the “terrain” within our bodies is to the prevention and treatment of cancer.

He is the leading scientist pointing to (and nearly screaming at!) the SUPER-compelling evidence that says cancer is caused by dysfunctional energy metabolism—providing evidence that the genetic mutations are a secondary, downstream epiphenomenon of that primary cause.

He also showed us just how powerful it is to learn optimism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut this study just blows me away. Here’s the quick take.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApparently scientists have developed a tumor they can inject into rats such that 50% of the rats will be able to reject the tumor while 50% won’t be able to reject it and will, therefore, die.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, here’s the study: Take a bunch of rats. Give them all that tumor. Then split them up into three groups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGroup 1 is our Control group. They get the tumor then go on living their lives normally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGroup 2 is the Learned Helplessness group. That group of rats gets the tumor and then they are given random shocks they can’t avoid. As expected from a ton of other studies, these rats “\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/how-to-learn-optimism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003elearn helplessness\u003c/a\u003e” — basically giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGroup 3 is what we’ll call the Empowered group. These rats are given the same exact number of shocks they can’t control but then they’re given some additional shocks they can avoid by learning how to pull a lever to escape the shock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, the question of the study: What happens with the tumors?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs expected, 54% of the Control group rejected their tumor. But, only 23% of the Learned Helplessness group rejected their tumor. In other words, more than twice as many of the helpless rats died than the control group. That’s crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut here’s the really crazy part.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat third group that (eventually) learned how to avoid the shocks? 63% (!!!) of those guys rejected their tumor!!! Almost three times more lived than the helpless group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemember: They got the exact same number of shocks as the helpless group. But… They also learned how to avoid them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoral of the study? We need to REFUSE to allow ourselves to become helpless.

(If you’re looking for a book to read, start with that one.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat did he tell us works? What levers can we pull to deal with cancer?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, first we need to know that we can do a LOT to combat cancer beyond the traditional Western approaches of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us we need to make “The Terrain” inhospitable to cancer. We need to cut off cancer’s supply lines and quit fueling its growth. We start with that Anticancer, empowered mindset as per our last +1. Then he says we need to focus on 4 primary things:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Environment\u003c/strong\u003e: Removing all the toxic stuff in our houses — from the cleaning supplies to the cosmetics, soaps, shampoos, etc. Any one dose of one item by itself might not be toxic (which is why it isn’t regulated) BUT when you aggregate and compound all those little toxins into a non-stop “toxic cocktail,” the effects can be disastrous. So, eliminate that stuff. Replace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Nutrition\u003c/strong\u003e. Nutrition is HUGE. 2 key things we want to do: 1. Reduce inflammation (which cancer loves) by eliminating sugar and flour while Optimizing our Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio by eliminating vegetable oils and factory-farmed animals; and, 2. Reduce our mTOR response (which cancer loves) by reducing our protein consumption (particularly red meat). (We’ll talk more details in one of our next +1s.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Minds\u003c/strong\u003e. We’ve gotta learn how to manage our stress response — which goes back to the whole “Challenge vs. Threat” conversation we’ve been having. Optimizing our breathing and practicing meditation are scientifically proven ways to exit the fight-or-flight state and enter the calm state required for our body to heal itself. (Note: “Coherent breathing” at a rate of ~5 breaths per minute (3.5 if you’re over 6 feet tall) is huge. Practice!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Bodies\u003c/strong\u003e. In addition to the nutrition, we’ve gotta move and exercise and sleep. Don’t be sedentary for longer than 30 minutes and get out and walk and train to the extent you can. And, of course, get a good night of sleep and remember that our #1 culprit there will always be the late night bright lights from smartphones and TVs and computers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s the quick look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1.

But, according to a study done on over 1,000 adopted kids in Denmark, you’d be wrong. In their study, the fact that their biological parents got cancer had NO effect on the adopted kids. (Literally, none.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut guess what? If the kids’ ADOPTIVE parents got cancer before 50, the kids’ cancer mortality risk goes up FIVE times. (FIVE (!!!) times!!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy? How is that possible?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, the adoptive parents didn’t pass on genes (of course) but they \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e pass on HABITS.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, alas, THAT’s what matters most.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, knowing that is a REALLY powerful thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we get a cancer diagnosis (or a diabetes or a depression or a whatever diagnosis) and think, “Oh, wow. Must have lost the genetic lottery. Bummer. Nothing I could have done or could do.” then we come dangerously close to being like those helpless rats who give up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I learned in my Abnormal Psychology class at UCLA back in the day and Nobel-prize winner \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/elizabeth-blackburn-ph-d/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eElizabeth Blackburn\u003c/a\u003e tells us in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-telomere-effect-elizabeth-blackburn-elissa-epel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Telomere Effect\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, “Genes load the gun but the environment pulls the trigger.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust because you might have a genetic predisposition for something doesn’t mean you’re going to get that something.

We’ll save that for a longer conversation for another time.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second thing we want to do is reduce inflammation even further by Optimizing our omega-3 to omega-6 ratio. We do that by eliminating vegetable oils and factory-farmed animals from our diet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShort story there: Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory. Omega-6s are inflammatory. We need both. The ratio back in the hunter-gatherer days used to be 1 to 1. Now it’s something like 16 to 1 in favor of omega-6s. As \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/christopher-mcdougall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eChristopher McDougall\u003c/a\u003e puts it in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/natural-born-heroes-christopher-mcdougall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNatural Born Heroes\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, our bodies need a modest inflammatory response — think of a fire in the fireplace. But… With the modern western diet, we have a raging inferno of inflammation that’s burning down the house. Not good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePractical steps: First, eliminate vegetable oils. They didn’t exist pre-Industrial Revolution and yet today they account for a CRAZY % of calories. Go to your pantry and throw away everything with soybean oil, canola oil, safflower oil, etc. (Olive oil is fine! So is coconut oil.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, quit eating factory-farmed animal products. In addition to getting sick from eating grains they didn’t evolve to eat (and then being jacked up with antibiotics that you then consume), all that grain they eat leads those factory-farmed animals to have a disrupted omega-3 to omega-6 ratio which then negatively impacts your ratios. That’s one of the reasons you should only eat grass-fed beef.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third thing we want to do is reduce what’s known as mTOR activation that’s associated with nearly every cancer out there.

Stimulating mTOR by eating large amounts of protein is also one of the quickest ways to suppress cellular and mitochondrial autophagy, which prevents your body from effectively cleaning out debris and damaged cells. Even if you are optimizing everything you can to keep glucose and insulin levels low, eating excessive protein will still activate the mTOR pathway. If your goal is to treat disease and live long, doing this chronically is something you want to avoid.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMercola and Tony Robbins’ doctor, Dr. Gundry, tell us that we want to shoot for “adequate” protein. Not “high” or even “moderate” protein but “adequate” — enough to do the repair work that’s vital to our well-being but no more. They tell us we should aim for .5 grams of protein per lean body mass. So, for example, with my brother weighing in at 155 pounds at around a 20% body fat, he has 31 pounds of fat and 124 pounds of lean body mass. .5 x 124 is 62 grams of protein. With no more than 4 ounces of that coming from animal protein per day. You can track consumption via apps like \u003ca href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMyFitnessPal\u003c/a\u003e and a food scale (we use \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJMTNA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis OXO scale\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap: Fight inflammation and insulin issues by eliminating sugar and flour.

Of course, trying to keep an intellectual away from literature works about as well as recommending chastity to Homo sapiens, the sexiest primate of all. As soon as I could walk, I made a beeline for Harvard’s Countway medical library and punched mesothelioma into the computer’s bibliographic search program. An hour later, surrounded by the latest literature on abdominal mesothelioma, I realized with a gulp why my doctor had offered that humane advice. The literature couldn’t have been more brutally clear: mesothelioma is incurable, with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery. I sat stunned for about fifteen minutes, then smiled and said to myself: so that’s why they didn’t give me anything to read. Then my mind started to work again, thank goodness.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe continues by saying that when most people hear something like “a median mortality of eight months” they think, “I’m going to die in eight months.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGould, however, points out that his scientific training came in handy as he unpacked what that \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e means. A median survival rate of eight months, he says, means that half the people lived less than eight months and half lived longer. He also reasoned (correctly) that the distribution was probably “right-skewed” meaning there was a long tail to the right. Then he reasoned (correctly) that he had a chance to be in that long tail to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen he got to work to make sure he wound up in the right end of that distribution (literally and figuratively). He succeeded. He wound up living 30 times longer than that median predicted — another 20 years, eventually dying of an unrelated disease.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/david-servan-schreiber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDavid Servan-Schreiber\u003c/a\u003e puts it: \u003cem\u003e“[Gould] had lived thirty times longer than the oncologists had predicted.

It’s essential that we understand the fact that what we’re talking about here is not a “cleanse” or a “detox” or anything along those lines. Although many inspiring anecdotal stories exist out there on the Internet about various juicing/cleansing/detoxing protocols, that’s NOT what we’re talking about here and, with blessings to all those who have benefited from and swear by them, I would never bet my life (or my brother’s life or your life) on those approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we’re talking about here is a scientifically-grounded look at an alternative theory of cancer supported by a growing body of peer-reviewed, empirically sound data. There’s a BIG difference between that and the “cancer cures” we can find on the Internet. And, that’s one of the reasons why most primary care physicians and oncologists freak out when they hear you’re doing something other than traditional approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve shared all this research with our traditional team. And, we’ve gotten smart about how to communicate our approach. Which (along with the astonishing (!) therapeutic benefits my brother has experienced thus far) has led our oncologist to say to my brother, “If I were diagnosed with what you have (stage IIB pancreatic cancer), I’d do what you’re doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy would he say that? Because, pancreatic cancer is notoriously hard to treat from a traditional (read: genetic origin!) perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, you know \u003cem\u003ewhen\u003c/em\u003e he said that? It wasn’t in our first meeting. In that initial meeting when he delivered the prognosis he literally didn’t look at my brother once. He had the very difficult job of communicating a very heavy prognosis and all my brother could see from the table was the side of his doctor’s face as he described what was going on to Rick’s wife, Kristin. It wasn’t a good day to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe changed his tone after he looked at my brother’s PET scan that showed NO SIGNS of cancer—after 5 weeks of SUPER intense nutritional and lifestyle therapeutic intervention that we’ll discuss. (Although we didn’t have a “before” PET scan to compare it to, that’s not supposed to happen with stage IIB pancreatic.) He and the other doctor who reviewed the PET + CT scans said, “If we didn’t know you had cancer, we wouldn’t know you had cancer after looking at those scans.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, there are a lot of variables at play and, again, we didn’t have a baseline to compare it to, and this is a sample size of one and we have a long way to go in our Optimizing journey, etc. etc. etc. but I am extremely confident that our metabolic approach to my brother’s cancer helped halt his cancer’s growth.

(Or, from Wes our UPS driver.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough our kind and earnest doctor only had a few days of nutrition in medical school, you’d think this lesson would’ve made it on the agenda at some point in his advanced oncological training, eh?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI might have politely delivered the Warburg memo (with a playful fist bump) in our first appointment when I questioned why there was a candy bowl in his reception area. Good news: We were planning to take a picture of that candy bowl a week later for the documentary we’re working on and we were very happy to see that it was removed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.P.S. To bring that point home: As I told my brother, eating candy while getting chemo is like feeding cancer with your right hand while you try to kill it with chemo in the left arm. That makes NO SENSE.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.P.P.S. We’re working on a documentary with my dear friend Pat Solomon.

(HAH!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which begs a few questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, you may wonder: What’s a ketogenic diet? And, why is it relevant?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, a therapeutic ketogenic diet is a very low carbohydrate, adequate protein, high healthy-fat, nutrient-dense diet that shifts your body’s primary source of energy metabolism from glucose to what’s known as “ketones.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ketones produced in a therapeutic ketogenic diet are relevant because THIS is how we strike cancer where it’s weak.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the deal. Remember our chat about the fact that “cancer loves sugar”? Well, cancer cells don’t just \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e sugar, cancer cells pretty much literally (!!!) can’t live \u003cem\u003ewithout\u003c/em\u003e sugar.

We NEED fats and proteins. We do NOT NEED carbs.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd this might just be THE most important point in our entire discussion about how to conquer cancer so let’s pay attention here:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCANCER CELLS ARE METABOLICALLY INFLEXIBLE.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich means that cancer cells can’t make the switch from using glucose for fuel to using ketones. (Whereas healthy cells easily can.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd THAT is how you checkmate the seemingly immortal cells and their out-of-control growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeverage their metabolic inflexibility. Cut off their fuel source. Step on their Achilles heel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePractically speaking, what that means is we need to drastically reduce carb intake (in the range of around 20 net carbs per day). When done with precision (ideally with the guidance of a nutrition pro) within the healthy fat, adequate protein, nutrient-dense parameters Miriam maps out in her book, you radically change your energy metabolism — nourishing your healthy cells with ketones while starving your cancer cells of glucose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is why my brother measures his glucose and ketones all day every day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s driven the glucose down: now in the 80s — which, again, is an epically awesome drop from the 145 diabetic, cancer-feasting-on-glucose zone to the optimal, “where’s the glucose?!” cancer cell starvation diet zone — WHILE driving his ketone levels up. Again, nourishing the metabolically flexible healthy cells while exploiting the metabolically INflexible cancer cell’s Achilles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTHAT is how we use targeted nutritional therapy to win the war on cancer.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"cancers-achilles-how-to-exploit","title":"Cancer’s Achilles: How to Exploit","subtitle":"Metabolic Inflexibility: Ketones + Glucose","videoThumbnail":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/videos/thumbnails/original/Optimize-0390-cancers-achilles-how-to-exploit-thumb.jpg","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PlusOne","id":"34749","authorizationState":"ANONYMOUS","contentType":"PLUSONE","audioUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/downloads/mp3s/files/Optimize-0391-radical-remission.mp3","number":391,"intro":"This is our final idea in our second +1 series on Cancer.

I am eternally grateful to Ben (seriously, thank you, brother) for connecting me with Nasha (pronounced “nay-shuh”). I felt like I met a soul-sister when we chatted (and I have tears in my eyes as I type this) and I am BEYOND thrilled that Nasha is now my brother’s lead consulting oncologist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe’s not only the quintessential cancer-thriver exemplar, she’s also a world-class physician who provides a detailed roadmap on how to Optimize our “terrain.” More on that in a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, another story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I’ve mentioned, my brother was diagnosed with stage IIB pancreatic cancer. That’s pretty much at least in the running for top cancer diagnosis you don’t want. The prognosis and protocol are terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLong story short, the “standard care” for this (which, btw, oncologists have a fiduciary responsibility to recommend even though the survival rates are terrible) is a Whipple procedure which, as per one surgeon we consulted, is like “getting hit by two Mack trucks.” Half your intestinal insides are moved around after the head of your pancreas is lopped off. It’s not a pleasant surgery and the life expectancy numbers after it are not good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter meeting with that surgeon in Los Angeles, my brother and his family drove an hour south to Huntington Beach where they lived. I drove an hour north to Ojai where I live. We were on the phone talking about our meeting and plan the whole way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt some point, it became clear that we needed to get more clarity on the actual quality of life and life expectancy post surgery as we hadn’t asked yet and, at the time, it was looking like we needed to do the procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI got off with them and called the surgeon as I was driving. It was just me and him and I asked him to be candid. In a tone bordering as close to despair as a surgeon can have, he told me the five-year survival rates. Not good. Then I said, “OK. Let’s say we’re in the long-tail and we get through the five years. Is there some kind of max number of years we can live on the other side of that?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe replied with even graver tones. “Well, I’ve never seen anyone live this long with my patients but, anecdotally [said with a tone that gave the impression he didn’t seem to believe the stories and we certainly shouldn’t expect it], I’ve heard people have lived as long as ten years.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI get tears in my eyes as I type THAT as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI thanked him for being so generous with his time and so candid with his thoughts and then sat there stunned as I was driving. I needed to call my brother and his wife back (with their two kids in the back listening on speaker) as they were waiting for me and knew my chat with the surgeon would be brief. But I couldn’t call them. I didn’t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI tried calling my wife, Alexandra, but she was already asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, I called my brother back and I don’t even know what I said as I tiptoed around what the surgeon told me trying to be direct but intuitively knowing that there had to be a better set of options and prognosis…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe point of sharing that story is this: A week later I talked to my new friend, Nasha Winters — the I’m still alive 25 years after I was told I’d be dead and now I’ve helped thousands of others as a naturopathic oncologist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuess what she told me?

<div class="line-clamp-2">My brother was recently diagnosed with cancer. As I wrapped my brain around how to best help him, I realized that, unfortunately (and obviously), our family is not alone in fighting cancer. Although we haven’t met (yet!), I consider you a friend and a part of our extended family. So, I created this class imagining myself supporting you and your family as your friend if you happen to be dealing with cancer like us. Big Ideas we explore include understanding the fact that our habits are more influential than our genes, the importance of an empowered mindset, and the nuts and bolts of what we scientifically know helps Optimize “the terrain” (from nutrition and movement to stress management and environmental toxins) to best prevent and fight cancer. I hope you enjoy and I’m sending love to you and your fam!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">In Conquering Cancer 101 we focused on the nuts-and-bolts of how to Optimize our terrain and make sure we’re cutting off cancer’s supply lines while getting our minds strong and aiming for the long tail, etc. Our primary source of inspiration for that class was Anticancer by David Servan-Schreiber and the dozens of references to cancer in other Notes over the years.



In Conquering Cancer 102, we cover all the wisdom I’ve picked up since that class over the last month. Theme: Rethinking Cancer: Theory + Therapy. Featuring Big Ideas from Tripping over the Truth (great intellectual overview of the history of cancer theory/therapy), The Metabolic Approach to Cancer (GREAT (!) practical roadmap on how to Optimize terrain by my brother’s new consulting oncologist), Cancer as a Metabolic Disease (by the leading research scientist on the approach we’re following), Keto for Cancer (by my brother’s day-to-day nutritional consultant), and Radical Remission (by a leading researcher on who’s studied 1,000+ case studies of people who have thrived outside of traditional approaches).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the third book specifically on cancer I got after my brother’s recent diagnosis. When I asked my friend (and coach) Ben Greenfield what books I should be reading he told me to read this one and to “follow it to the t.” So, of course, I immediately got it. It’s astonishingly good. I echo Ben’s advice and say, THIS is the book to read if you or a loved one are dealing with cancer. Dr. Nasha Winters was diagnosed with stage IV terminal ovarian cancer 25 years ago. She was given 3 to 6 months to live and was told Western medicine couldn’t do anything for her so she committed herself to figuring it out—becoming a naturopathic doctor and acupuncturist and fellow of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology in the process. 25 years later (!) she’s thriving and has helped thousands of others thrive through cancer by focusing on, as per the title, a “metabolic approach to cancer” that integrates “deep nutrition, the ketogenic diet, and nontoxic bio-individualized therapies.”</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I got this book immediately after my older brother had a major surgery and was diagnosed with cancer. David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PhD, was a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and published more than ninety articles in scientific journals. David was diagnosed with brain cancer at 31 years old. At the time he was very skeptical of anything but the well-known, traditional Western therapeutic approaches. But, as he drilled into the scientific literature, he realized just how important Optimizing the “terrain” within our bodies is to the prevention and treatment of cancer. This book is an overview of what he discovered. It’s incredibly thoughtful and thorough. Big Ideas we explore include Genes vs. Habits, cutting off cancer’s supply lines, the three keys to nutritional detox, the anticancer mind and the best protection against cancer.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our eight Note on cancer books. It’s also our second Note on Thomas Seyfried’s work. We started with the journal article also called “Cancer as a metabolic disease.” Seyfried has taught and conducted research in the fields of neurogenetics, neurochemistry and cancer for more than twenty-five years at Yale University and Boston College. He is the leading scientist pointing to (and nearly screaming at!) the SUPER-compelling evidence that says cancer is caused by dysfunctional energy metabolism—providing evidence that the genetic mutations are a secondary, downstream epiphenomenon of that primary cause. Big Ideas we explore include the metabolic theory vs. the genetic theory of cancer, nuclear-cytoplasm studies (perhaps the most powerful case for the metabolic theory), metastasis (Mr. Mo builds your MOAT!!), apoptotic vs. necrotic cell death (aka naturel/nontoxic vs. unnatural/toxic), and the cancer solar system (make sure the metabolic cancer-sun is in the discussion!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fourth Note specifically related to cancer I created after my brother’s diagnosis. The Note is on an open access article from the scientific journal Nutrition and Metabolism that Nasha Winters says is a “must read!” (I agree! Super compelling.) Thomas Seyfried is the leading research scientist making the case for the metabolic approach to cancer (vs. as we’ve discussed, a genetic approach). He and Laura Shelton brilliantly and lucidly unpack the case for cancer as a metabolic disease. Bonus: Your brain gets a nice workout as every word is chosen wisely for peer-reviewable hardiness. Big Ideas we explore include the genes vs. metabolism discussion, why your mitochondria are so important, and the two key therapeutic responses if you believe the metabolic approach.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the seventh Note we’ve created on books specifically on cancer. Kelly Turner is one of the world’s leading researchers and psychotherapists in the field of integrative oncology. She got her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley (one of the best graduate programs out there) studying the remarkable stories of people who were told they had a limited amount of time to live and then RADICALLY defied those odds. In fact, she’s studied over 1,000 (!) case studies of what she calls “Radical Remission.” In the book, she shares the nine “key factors that can unlock your pathway to dramatic healing.” Big Ideas we explore: The definition of Radical Remission, the #1 key factor (hint: change your diet!), being a patient vs. a CONQUEROR, symptoms vs. systems, epigenetics, and identifying your reason for living.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the second book specifically on cancer I’ve read after my brother Rick was diagnosed with cancer. (The first book was Anticancer.) Travis Christofferson is a science writer. In this great book, he provides a compelling look at the history of scientific research on cancer and the traditional therapeutic models offered—juxtaposing the (traditionally accepted) Somatic Mutation Theory (or SMT) with the (much more compelling) Metabolic Theory of Cancer. Big Ideas we explore include the fact that we’ve spent $100 billion researching cancer and spend $100 billion annually on cancer medications and we’ve seen ZERO improvements in the real death rates from cancer since the 1950s. We look at the one prime cause of cancer (via the Warburg Effect), a fascinating experiment with “recon” cells demonstrating that it's the cytoplasm (not the nucleus) that drives cancer, how to starve cancer and a vision of cancer clinics in the future.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the fifth Note I've created specifically on cancer after my brother's diagnosis. Miriam Kalamian is one of the leading nutrition consultants focused on cancer. She helps people approach cancer with a therapeutic ketogenic diet. In fact, she's my brother's day-to-day nutritional consultant. She has been AMAZING. (And, given the fact that food is, ultimately, our most powerful medicine, in many ways I consider her our brother's primary care physician. :) People have asked what nutritional approach we're following. THIS is it. The book is PACKED with wisdom on, as the sub-title suggests "Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy as a Targeted Nutritional Strategy." Big Ideas we explore include: Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy 101, the basic plan, "Diet doesn't matter" - Your Oncologist | "Yes, it does." - Your Cancer, Boost + Ensure (eliminate to boost and ensure well-being), and the importance of measuring glucose and ketones daily.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the sixth book in our Conquering Cancer series. It’s a great overview of the importance of an integrative oncological approach written by two naturopathic medical doctors with over 40 years of combined clinical experience and a ton of experience researching and teaching these principles to other medical professionals and their patients. It’s almost encyclopedic in its analysis of “outside the box cancer therapies” and the kind of book you wish you could instantly download into your traditional oncologist’s brain for a quick introduction to how a powerful integrative approach works.

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the ninth Note on cancer we’ve done so far. I picked this book up after Travis Christofferson referenced it a couple times in Tripping over the Truth. Clifton Leaf is a great writer and the Editor-in-Chief of Fortune magazine. He tells us that nine years before he wrote this book he began his reporting on cancer with a five-word question: How did we get here Specifically, Leaf wanted to know: How did we get to a point, 40+ years after Nixon declared War on Cancer, where the real death rate is, essentially, the same as it was in the 1950s? That’s a great question. And, he provides a powerful look at what’s gone wrong and how to fix it. Big Ideas we explore include the power of taking a different route to the summit, the truth (but only in small doses), dogma vs. science, the power of prevention, and the power of counting—aka, the truth in large doses.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is the 10th book on cancer we’ve featured so far since my brother’s cancer diagnosis. Although brilliantly written (Mukherjee won a Pulitzer for it), I didn’t start with this 570-page tome because, I read this book last because, frankly, I wasn’t interested in starting with a book that featured, as per the inside flap, “cancer as the protagonist.” I wanted my BROTHER (and you and your loved ones) to star as the conqueror of cancer, not the other way around. Alas, frankly, this book was painful to read as Mukherjee is a devout follower of the “cancer is a genetic disease” camp—which is why, from his vantage point, cancer looks unbeatable (and why, from my vantage point, we’re *losing* the War on Cancer). This Note is a little different than all the rest in that we’ll take a critical look at the underlying premise of the book (i.e, that cancer is primarily a genetic disease) and present a way to conquer the emperor (by seeing cancer as a mitochondrial METABOLIC disease).</div>

He also showed us just how powerful it is to learn optimism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut this study just blows me away. Here’s the quick take.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eApparently scientists have developed a tumor they can inject into rats such that 50% of the rats will be able to reject the tumor while 50% won’t be able to reject it and will, therefore, die.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, here’s the study: Take a bunch of rats. Give them all that tumor. Then split them up into three groups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGroup 1 is our Control group. They get the tumor then go on living their lives normally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGroup 2 is the Learned Helplessness group. That group of rats gets the tumor and then they are given random shocks they can’t avoid. As expected from a ton of other studies, these rats “\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/how-to-learn-optimism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003elearn helplessness\u003c/a\u003e” — basically giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGroup 3 is what we’ll call the Empowered group. These rats are given the same exact number of shocks they can’t control but then they’re given some additional shocks they can avoid by learning how to pull a lever to escape the shock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, the question of the study: What happens with the tumors?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs expected, 54% of the Control group rejected their tumor. But, only 23% of the Learned Helplessness group rejected their tumor. In other words, more than twice as many of the helpless rats died than the control group. That’s crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut here’s the really crazy part.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat third group that (eventually) learned how to avoid the shocks? 63% (!!!) of those guys rejected their tumor!!! Almost three times more lived than the helpless group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemember: They got the exact same number of shocks as the helpless group. But… They also learned how to avoid them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoral of the study? We need to REFUSE to allow ourselves to become helpless. We need to KNOW we can influence our lives and learn how to pull some levers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat levers? Well, again, that’s what ALL of these +1s are about — tiny little incremental Optimizing levers that, when aggregated and compounded, make a HUGE difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it all starts with our Empowered mindset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1: How’s your mindset?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd: What’s one lever you can pull to avoid some of those shocks?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other words, what’s the #1 thing you KNOW you could be doing to Optimize your life?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, what’s the #1 thing you KNOW you need to STOP doing?

We need to cut off cancer’s supply lines and quit fueling its growth. We start with that Anticancer, empowered mindset as per our last +1. Then he says we need to focus on 4 primary things:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Environment\u003c/strong\u003e: Removing all the toxic stuff in our houses — from the cleaning supplies to the cosmetics, soaps, shampoos, etc. Any one dose of one item by itself might not be toxic (which is why it isn’t regulated) BUT when you aggregate and compound all those little toxins into a non-stop “toxic cocktail,” the effects can be disastrous. So, eliminate that stuff. Replace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Nutrition\u003c/strong\u003e. Nutrition is HUGE. 2 key things we want to do: 1. Reduce inflammation (which cancer loves) by eliminating sugar and flour while Optimizing our Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio by eliminating vegetable oils and factory-farmed animals; and, 2. Reduce our mTOR response (which cancer loves) by reducing our protein consumption (particularly red meat). (We’ll talk more details in one of our next +1s.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Minds\u003c/strong\u003e. We’ve gotta learn how to manage our stress response — which goes back to the whole “Challenge vs. Threat” conversation we’ve been having. Optimizing our breathing and practicing meditation are scientifically proven ways to exit the fight-or-flight state and enter the calm state required for our body to heal itself. (Note: “Coherent breathing” at a rate of ~5 breaths per minute (3.5 if you’re over 6 feet tall) is huge. Practice!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4. \u003cstrong\u003eOur Bodies\u003c/strong\u003e. In addition to the nutrition, we’ve gotta move and exercise and sleep. Don’t be sedentary for longer than 30 minutes and get out and walk and train to the extent you can. And, of course, get a good night of sleep and remember that our #1 culprit there will always be the late night bright lights from smartphones and TVs and computers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s the quick look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1.

(Literally, none.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut guess what? If the kids’ ADOPTIVE parents got cancer before 50, the kids’ cancer mortality risk goes up FIVE times.

These have NO place in any diet and certainly not one if we’re either fighting cancer or all in on preventing cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSugar disrupts our insulin and creates inflammation — the perfect fuels for cancer. In \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/eat-move-sleep-tom-rath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEat Move Sleep\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/tom-rath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eTom Rath\u003c/a\u003e calls sugar “Candy for cancer.” The head nurse and the dietician in my brother’s hospital both said, “Cancer LOVES sugar.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Yet, when I asked the nurse what the hospital’s nutritional philosophy was she groaned and said they didn’t have one. And, I still can’t wrap my brain around the fact that the oncologist had a bowl full of candy in the sign-in area of his office and told my brother he didn’t need to think about changing his nutrition at all although he was admitted with a blood glucose level in the diabetic range. We’ll save that for a longer conversation for another time.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second thing we want to do is reduce inflammation even further by Optimizing our omega-3 to omega-6 ratio. We do that by eliminating vegetable oils and factory-farmed animals from our diet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShort story there: Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory. Omega-6s are inflammatory. We need both. The ratio back in the hunter-gatherer days used to be 1 to 1. Now it’s something like 16 to 1 in favor of omega-6s. As \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/christopher-mcdougall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eChristopher McDougall\u003c/a\u003e puts it in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/natural-born-heroes-christopher-mcdougall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNatural Born Heroes\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, our bodies need a modest inflammatory response — think of a fire in the fireplace. But… With the modern western diet, we have a raging inferno of inflammation that’s burning down the house. Not good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePractical steps: First, eliminate vegetable oils. They didn’t exist pre-Industrial Revolution and yet today they account for a CRAZY % of calories. Go to your pantry and throw away everything with soybean oil, canola oil, safflower oil, etc. (Olive oil is fine! So is coconut oil.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, quit eating factory-farmed animal products. In addition to getting sick from eating grains they didn’t evolve to eat (and then being jacked up with antibiotics that you then consume), all that grain they eat leads those factory-farmed animals to have a disrupted omega-3 to omega-6 ratio which then negatively impacts your ratios. That’s one of the reasons you should only eat grass-fed beef.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third thing we want to do is reduce what’s known as mTOR activation that’s associated with nearly every cancer out there. Here’s how \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/dr-joseph-mercola/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDr. Mercola\u003c/a\u003e puts it in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/fat-for-fuel-joseph-mercola/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFat for Fuel\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e: \u003cem\u003e“Of all the nutrients that stimulate mTOR, amino acids — which are derived from protein — are the most potent. Stimulating mTOR by eating large amounts of protein is also one of the quickest ways to suppress cellular and mitochondrial autophagy, which prevents your body from effectively cleaning out debris and damaged cells. Even if you are optimizing everything you can to keep glucose and insulin levels low, eating excessive protein will still activate the mTOR pathway. If your goal is to treat disease and live long, doing this chronically is something you want to avoid.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMercola and Tony Robbins’ doctor, Dr. Gundry, tell us that we want to shoot for “adequate” protein. Not “high” or even “moderate” protein but “adequate” — enough to do the repair work that’s vital to our well-being but no more. They tell us we should aim for .5 grams of protein per lean body mass. So, for example, with my brother weighing in at 155 pounds at around a 20% body fat, he has 31 pounds of fat and 124 pounds of lean body mass. .5 x 124 is 62 grams of protein. With no more than 4 ounces of that coming from animal protein per day. You can track consumption via apps like \u003ca href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMyFitnessPal\u003c/a\u003e and a food scale (we use \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJMTNA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis OXO scale\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap: Fight inflammation and insulin issues by eliminating sugar and flour. Then fight inflammation even more by eliminating vegetable oils and factory-farmed animal products. Then bring your protein consumption down to “adequate” levels to turn off the mTOR activation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThats’ our 80/20 Anticancer Nutrition strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday’s +1.

Of course, trying to keep an intellectual away from literature works about as well as recommending chastity to Homo sapiens, the sexiest primate of all. As soon as I could walk, I made a beeline for Harvard’s Countway medical library and punched mesothelioma into the computer’s bibliographic search program. An hour later, surrounded by the latest literature on abdominal mesothelioma, I realized with a gulp why my doctor had offered that humane advice. The literature couldn’t have been more brutally clear: mesothelioma is incurable, with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery.

Step on their Achilles heel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePractically speaking, what that means is we need to drastically reduce carb intake (in the range of around 20 net carbs per day). When done with precision (ideally with the guidance of a nutrition pro) within the healthy fat, adequate protein, nutrient-dense parameters Miriam maps out in her book, you radically change your energy metabolism — nourishing your healthy cells with ketones while starving your cancer cells of glucose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is why my brother measures his glucose and ketones all day every day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s driven the glucose down: now in the 80s — which, again, is an epically awesome drop from the 145 diabetic, cancer-feasting-on-glucose zone to the optimal, “where’s the glucose?!” cancer cell starvation diet zone — WHILE driving his ketone levels up. Again, nourishing the metabolically flexible healthy cells while exploiting the metabolically INflexible cancer cell’s Achilles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTHAT is how we use targeted nutritional therapy to win the war on cancer.\u003c/p\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4e:T1c80,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003cp\u003eThis is our final idea in our second +1 series on \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/big-ideas/how-to-conquer-cancer-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCancer\u003c/a\u003e.

We look at the one prime cause of cancer (via the Warburg Effect), a fascinating experiment with “recon” cells demonstrating that it's the cytoplasm (not the nucleus) that drives cancer, how to starve cancer and a vision of cancer clinics in the future.\",\"title\":\"Tripping over the Truth\",\"pnSubtitle\":\"How the Metabolic Theory of Cancer Is Overturning One of Medicine's Most Entrenched Paradigms\",\"slug\":\"tripping-over-the-truth-travis-christofferson\",\"authorizationState\":\"FREECONTENT\",\"authorDetails\":[{\"__typename\":\"Author\",\"id\":\"2922\",\"slug\":\"travis-christofferson\",\"authorName\":\"Travis Christofferson\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/travis-christofferson.jpg\",\"tagline\":\"Author of Tripping Over the Truth: The return of the metabolic theory of cancer illuminates a new and hopeful path to a cure.\",\"contentType\":\"AUTHOR\"}],\"coverImage\":\"https://assets.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/book-covers/tripping-over-the-truth-cover.png\",\"contentType\":\"PHILOSOPHERNOTE\",\"library\":{\"__typename\":\"Library\",\"saved\":false,\"completed\":false,\"faved\":false}},{\"__typename\":\"PhilosopherNote\",\"id\":\"31643\",\"intro\":\"This is the fifth Note I've created specifically on cancer after my brother's diagnosis.

It’s almost encyclopedic in its analysis of “outside the box cancer therapies” and the kind of book you wish you could instantly download into your traditional oncologist’s brain for a quick introduction to how a powerful integrative approach works.
