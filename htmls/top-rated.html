As we know, the word directly translates as “virtue” or “excellence” but has a deeper meaning—something along the lines of “expressing our \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/big-ideas/acorns-kittens-and-your-highest-potential/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ehighest potential\u003c/a\u003e.” When? Moment to moment to moment. When we express what we’re capable of in any given moment there’s no room for regret or all the other negative stuff. We feel great. We flourish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich leads us to the next Greek word: \u003cstrong\u003eEudaimonia\u003c/strong\u003e. The word \u003cem\u003eeudaimonia\u003c/em\u003e literally means “good soul.” When we live with Areté, we’re on good terms with our inner soul. That feels REALLY good. Hence, having a “good soul” or eudaimonia was the Greek word for a deep sense of happiness and well-being.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, when you put \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/big-ideas/arete/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAreté\u003c/a\u003e + Eudaimonia together you could say that it’s as if God’s in the house.

We become \u003cstrong\u003eHērōs\u003c/strong\u003e. As we’ve discussed, the ancient root of the word \u003cstrong\u003eHērōs \u003c/strong\u003edidn’t mean “tough guy” or “killer of bad guys.” It meant PROTECTOR. A Hero has strength for TWO.

But before he mastered \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e, he discovered something very interesting about how we learn HELPLESSNESS.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the short story: Decades ago, Seligman was in a lab with dogs. He split them into a couple groups. One group was given shocks but they could figure out how to avoid them easily. The other group was given random shocks that they couldn’t avoid. That was the first part of the study.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the second part of the study, the dogs were given a shock again but this time it was super easy for all of them to learn how to avoid the shock. The group that easily escaped the shock the first time easily learned the second time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, get this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe group that couldn’t avoid the random shocks in the first part of the experiment, \u003cem\u003edidn’t even try\u003c/em\u003e to learn how to escape the shock in the second part — even though it was now super easy to learn. They just curled up in a ball and let the shocks continue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey had LEARNED HELPLESSNESS.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScientists have replicated that finding with other stimuli in studies with other animals, including humans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut get this: Not all people learn helplessness. Some of them, even after being bombarded with “shocks” maintain an empowered response. Seligman wanted to understand what made THEM tick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe distilled the essence of what he learned into another one of his great books called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/learned-optimism-martin-seligman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearned Optimism\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. It all comes down to the 3 P’s of Optimism — which we’ll talk about in a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut first, why we should care: Learned helplessness is basically a one-way ticket to depression. If you’ve been shocked by life and learned to curl up in a ball, you’ve given up your power and that leads to places we don’t want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution: LEARN OPTIMISM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnter: \u003cstrong\u003eThe 3 P’s of Optimism: Permanence + Pervasiveness + Personalization\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the super quick look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePermanence.\u003c/strong\u003e Let’s say something challenging happens. The Optimist will say, “Bring it on. I’ll crush it and then it will pass.” The Pessimist, on the other hand, says, “Gah. Another challenge. This is always going to suck.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, when something GOOD happens, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/lets-try-to-be-optimists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eOptimist\u003c/a\u003e and the Pessimist flip their orientations. The Pessimist, who was sure the bad thing would be permanent, thinks the \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e thing will be fleeting. And, vice-versa with the Optimist. Good thing? That’s here to stay!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(How do \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e show up?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePervasiveness.\u003c/strong\u003e The Optimist is able to isolate the “bad” event into one compartment of their life. If they have a challenging discussion at work, they don’t say, “My whole life sucks.” They don’t make it \u003cem\u003epervasive\u003c/em\u003e the way a \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/big-ideas/prove-the-pessimist-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePessimist\u003c/a\u003e tends to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, the opposite happens with the good stuff. It’s only a lucky break in one part of their life for the Pessimist and another sign of all the awesomeness for the Optimist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(How do \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e show up?)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonalization.\u003c/strong\u003e Then we have the third P. If a bad thing happens, an Optimist is more likely to see the environmental circumstances that might’ve led to the event occurring while the Pessimist will take it all personally. Of course, the Optimist will have a healthy level of “needs work!” ownership when appropriate, but they won’t beat themselves up unnecessarily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, again, the opposite happens with the good stuff.

I’m going to say that again for dramatic effect. A deep meditation is no better for you than a shallow meditation. I am defining a deep meditation as one in which time passes quickly, you have few thoughts, and you generally enjoy the sitting. In a shallow meditation, the time may pass more slowly, you may feel like you are just sitting there having thoughts the whole time, and you may not enjoy the sitting itself. Both are beneficial for you. A deep meditation means the body is getting deep rest; a shallow meditation means the body is releasing stresses in the form of thoughts. One is not better for you than the other. Write it on your mirror, make a T-shirt, tattoo it on your forehead.

That delay doesn’t help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution? Create micro goals (today!) that give you the chance to create a constant stream of micro wins. PERFECT way to fuel the fire as you crush it day in and day out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, that formula might sound too abstract to be useful but, in my experience, it’s incredibly powerful.

Max 1 or 2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe structure of a good Wildly Important Goal (or “WIG”) looks like this: We will go from x to y by z. That could be a health goal like I will train from today to December 9th for a Spartan Race or a creative production goal like we will go from 0 to 1,000 +1s by January 1, 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscipline #2.\u003c/strong\u003e The 4DX guys tell us that our WIG is a “Lag Measure.” It \u003cem\u003elags behind\u003c/em\u003e other things you will do to make that goal happen. Those things that produce the results? They’re called “Lead Measures.” You want to focus on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, with a WIG lag measure of doing a Spartan Race, you might have a lead measure that is “Hit the Trail every morning.” For the creative production lag WIG, the lead measure could be the Deep Work time blocks put in every day to produce the content.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscipline #3.\u003c/strong\u003e Once you’ve defined your WIG and your Lead Measure, it’s time to keep score. You’ve gotta know how you’re doing. More on that soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, know that the primary score you want to keep isn’t how you’re doing on your Lag, it’s how you’re doing on your LEAD. Did you hit the Trail? Did you bust out x number of Deep Work time blocks? Most people obsess about the outcome lag measures. We don’t want to be like most people.

Like a coach. Or supportive parent or friend. Or ME. (Hah.) “YOU’VE GOT THIS!!!” You can also persuade \u003cem\u003eyourself\u003c/em\u003e through positive self-talk and an antifragile, confident mindset.

In a three-month experiment in eight different hospitals around the world, the rate of serious complications for surgical patients fell by 36 percent after introduction of the checklist, and deaths fell by 47 percent. Even Gawande himself, a highly trained surgeon with years of operating experience, found that his own performance improved notably after he started using the checklist. His point is that surgery, like any complex task, requires a regular check of all the fundamentals—to liberate the team to focus on the work and any unexpected circumstances that may arise.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat surgical checklist was crazy simple. So simple that many surgeons (who have trained for decades to do what they do) thought it was laughably useless.

An undefeated mind isn’t one that never feels discouraged or despairing; it’s one that continues on in spite of it. Even when we can’t find a smile to save us, even when we’re tired beyond all endurance, possessing an undefeated mind means never forgetting that defeat comes not from failing but from giving up. An undefeated mind doesn’t fill itself with false hope, but with hopes to find real solutions, even solutions it may not want or like. An undefeated mind is itself what grants us access to the \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/optimize/101/creativity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ecreativity\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, strength, and courage necessary to find those real solutions, viewing obstacles not as distractions or detours off the main path of our lives but as the very means by which we capture the lives we want. Victory may not be promised to any of us, but possessing an undefeated mind means behaving as though it is, as though to win we only need to wage an all-out struggle and work harder than everyone else, trying everything we can, and when that fails trying everything we think we can’t, in full understanding that we have no one on whom we can rely for victory but ourselves. Possessing an undefeated mind, we understand that there’s no obstacle from which we can’t create some kind of value. We view any such doubt as delusion.

Probably nowhere near as well as when they’re rested, happy and all that, eh?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe important thing to note here is that WE were exactly the same in both situations.

PRESENCE. In fact, Stanford’s Emma Seppälä tells us: “Charisma, simply put, is absolute presence.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAbsolute presence\u003c/em\u003e.

Don’t be the person constantly checking your phone for the latest push notification. You know what that tells the person you’re with? That you just don’t care that much about them. And, that’s a great way to kill all connection and charisma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Another pro tip: Make eye contact.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur second facet of charisma? Power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresence is the first step, but, according to Cabane, it’s not enough by itself. People are constantly, subconsciously detecting power or a lack thereof. Therefore, if we want to dial up our charisma, we need to dial up our personal power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEasiest way to do that? Your body language. Stand tall, breathe deeply, smile. And, while you’re at it, another great, quick way to boost your power before an interaction is to recall a prior success. Visualize it. FEEL the power you had when you crushed it. Soak THAT in, smile and go connect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third facet of charisma? Warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe may be present and powerful but if the person with whom we’re interacting doesn’t think we’ll use that power for their good then… no charisma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… Dial up your presence and your power AND your warmth.

Practical wisdom allows us to make decisions that improve our eudaimonia, the (ethically) good life. Courage can be physical, but more broadly refers to the moral aspect—for instance, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances… Temperance makes it possible for us to control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to excesses. Justice, for Socrates and the Stoics, refers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: That’s from Part II of the book: “How to Behave in the World.” The short answer on how to behave? It’s revealed in the title of the first chapter from this section: “It’s All About Character (and Virtue).”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMassimo thoughtfully walks us through the four cardinal Stoic virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us: \u003cem\u003e“The Stoics derived their understanding of virtue from Socrates, who believed that all virtues are actually different aspects of the same underlying feature: wisdom. The reason why wisdom is the ‘chief good,’ according to Socrates, is rather simple: it is the only human ability that is good under every and all circumstance.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also connects these four cardinal virtues to the modern Positive Psychology movement which was founded on an exploration of shared virtues among all cultures—which I found particularly awesome because the next book on my stack to read is called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-power-of-character-strengths-robert-mcgrath-ryan-niemiec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Power of Character Strengths\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and was written by two of the leading scientists behind the VIA Institute on Character.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMassimo says: \u003cem\u003e“Other cultures have developed, more or less independently, their own sets of virtues as socially important character traits, each arriving at its own classification of the relations among virtues. Interestingly, though, there is much more convergence than we would expect in these days when cultural relativism is so often portrayed as the norm. A study by Katherine Dahlsgaard, Christopher Peterson, and Martin Seligman looked at how virtue is articulated in Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, and what they call ‘Athenian philosophy’ (mostly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). They found a rather surprising amount of congruence among all of these religious-philosophical traditions and identified a set of six ‘core’ virtues: Courage, Justice, Humanity, Temperance, Wisdom, and Transcendence.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFour of the six are indistinguishable from the Stoic virtues. Stoics also accepted the importance of ‘humanity’ and ‘transcendence,’ although they didn’t think of these as virtues, but rather as attitudes toward others (humanity) and toward the universe at large (transcendence).”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap and drop it into our Heroic framework.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Stoics had their four cardinal virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice. Modern scientists looked across a range of religious-philosophical doctrines across a range of cultures and found the same four virtues and added two: Humanity + Transcendence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think we can all agree that Wisdom + Courage + Temperance (or, as I prefer, Self-Mastery) are essential. Then, as we briefly discussed in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/musonius-rufus-musonius-rufus-cynthia-arrieu-king-william-irvine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eNote on Musonius Rufus\u003c/a\u003e, I think “Justice” is a very weak word to capture the LOVE the Stoics (and all other traditions) encouraged us to feel for their families, communities and world. So, why not just call the fourth virtue “Love”? Then we can throw the scientist’s “Justice” and “Humanity” under that umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow we have Wisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo run it through our Heroic model: We start by having Wisdom. We know the game we’re playing (eudaimonia!) AND, very importantly, how to play it well (operationalize virtue!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we cultivate our Self-Mastery (with an emphasis on the fundamentals so we can Optimize our Energy). Why? So we can more consistently live with both Courage (in all aspects of our lives but with an emphasis on Work) and so we can more consistently live with Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we do the hard work of operationalizing virtue, we make progress in closing the gap between who we are \u003cem\u003ecapable\u003c/em\u003e of being and who we are \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e being—more and more consistently living with eudaimonia and expressing the Optimus-best version of ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat leads us to Transcendence. From my vantage point, the eudaimonically-best version of ourselves naturally (almost \u003cem\u003eeffervescently\u003c/em\u003e) transcends self-interest and lives a life committed to more than just themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Greek word for that? Hērōs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe become modern, everyday “protectors” of our families and communities and world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have strength for two.

(Rick’s protege Shane Lopez described this as “Agency” — a sense of personal power that we have what it takes to make our dreams a reality.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have what Rick calls “\u003cstrong\u003eWaypower\u003c/strong\u003e.” Waypower is all about mapping out the plans for how you will attain your goal along with the wisdom to know that your first plan \u003cem\u003eprobably\u003c/em\u003e won’t work out perfectly — requiring you to continue optimizing your strategy while pursuing different routes to your goal.

Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCue + Craving + Response + Reward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have a cue in our environment that leads to a desire to do something, we respond and we get a reward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRepeat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat leads us to the 4 Laws—one for each of the elements of our habit loop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere they are:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… Want a \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/optimize/101/habits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ecreate good habit\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMake it obvious.

One particular paragraph captures the essence of our challenge so brilliantly that I think we should talk about it here. Here’s how he puts it: \u003cem\u003e“We live in a cacophonous age, swarming insects of noise and interruption buzzing about—emails, text messages, cable news, advertisements, cell phones, meetings, wireless Web connections, social media posts, and all the new intrusions invented by the time you are reading this. If leadership begins not with what you do but with who you are, then when and how do you escape the noise and find your purpose and summon the strength to pursue it? This book illustrates how leaders can—indeed must—be disciplined people who create the quiet space for disciplined thought and summon the strength for disciplined action. It is a message needed now more than ever, else we run the risk of waking up at the end of the year having accomplished little of significance, each year slipping by in a flurry of activity pointing nowhere. So take some quiet time, engage with this book, and commit to the hard work of alone time.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of which leads us to the point of Today’s +1: What we GET when we create solitude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKethledge and Erwin tells us we gain FOUR things when we have the discipline to deliberately step AWAY from the inputs and plug into our own thoughts without distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe get \u003cstrong\u003eClarity + Creativity + Emotional Balance + Moral Courage\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s only in solitude that we can get the Clarity on what’s \u003cem\u003etruly\u003c/em\u003e important in our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that Clarity, we focus our efforts on what matters and, as we do \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e in a deep work-solitude bubble, we enhance our Creativity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we creatively pursue things that really matter, we’re going to need Emotional Balance to manage the inevitable ups and downs of our heroic quest.

An astonishing 20% (!!!) of our total calories come from soybean oil alone. TWENTY PERCENT!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Pick up a bottle of salad dressing (even at a place like Whole Foods) and look at the first ingredient.

Stop following those statistically normative behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuick note on WHY vegetable oils are so bad: One of the big things we want to do is reduce the chronic inflammation within our bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the ways we can do that is to Optimize our omega-3 to omega-6 ratio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShort story there: Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory. Omega-6s are inflammatory. We need both. The ratio back in the hunter-gatherer days used to be 1 to 1. Now it’s something like 16 to 1 in favor of omega-6s.

So, walk on over to your pantry right now and throw away everything that has a vegetable oil in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ebtw: Fascinating Wikipedia fact regarding veggie oils, specifically the rebranding of “rapeseed” oil into “Canola” oil: “By the 1950s and 1960s, soybean oil had become the most popular vegetable oil in the US. In the mid-1970s, Canadian researchers developed a low-erucic-acid rapeseed cultivar. Because the word ‘rape’ was not considered optimal for marketing, they coined the name ‘canola’ (from ‘Canada Oil low acid’).”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e← Have that in mind when you throw out your “canola” oil and refuse to buy any more of the lab-made toxic edible foodlike substance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ebtw2: Fat is awesome and will provide the bulk of our calories as we move toward the ketogenic therapeutic diet.

That will help with inflammation. Next up on the anti-inflammatory push? Never eating a piece of meat or fish from an animal that was factory-farmed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to getting sick from eating grains they didn’t evolve to eat (and then being jacked up with antibiotics that you then consume), all that grain they eat leads those factory-farmed animals to have a disrupted omega-3 to omega-6 ratio which then negatively impacts your ratios. That’s one of the reasons you should only eat grass-fed beef.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(And, while we’re at it, skip the underwater factory farms as well.

Even if you are optimizing everything you can to keep glucose and insulin levels low, eating excessive protein will still activate the mTOR pathway.

Every human being has a perfect right to say either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and this does not bother an owner. An owner honors that right. Therefore, when owners hear ‘no,’ they don’t think something is wrong with the universe. They don’t conclude that life is unfair. They move right on to their next request. Life is requests and promises.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVictims spend the better part of their lives trying to avoid hearing the word ‘no,’ because they’ve made it mean rejection—total, thorough, and personal—rejection. It is little wonder they want to avoid it whenever possible. The trouble is that by avoiding ‘no,’ they also avoid ‘yes.’ The two go together. They live together.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe primary reason that people don’t get what they want in life is that they are afraid to ask for it.

I have a 10-year-old and a 9-year-old as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was struck by how cool it was that these super-successful and ambitious guys were so committed to being great dads. (I also remember a coaching session with another successful entrepreneur. When I asked him what he most wanted to get out of our time together, he said that he wanted to be a better father. I actually get tears in my eyes as I think about that.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, I briefly told them about the etymology of the word “parent.” As we discussed in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/bring-forth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis +1\u003c/a\u003e, the word \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e means “to bring forth.” Our primary job as parents is to simply help \u003cem\u003ebring forth\u003c/em\u003e the latent potential (genius!!) that is inherently within our kids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I shared three things that I think are the most powerful ways to help “bring forth” that awesomeness. Here they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eBe an Exemplar\u003c/strong\u003e. It’s a truism (because it’s true!!), but kids don’t listen to what we tell them to do, they model what we ACTUALLY do. Therefore, by far, the most important thing we can do for our kids is to be a shining, radiant demonstration of what we hope they will aspire to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ebtw: This is, by far, my greatest motivation as a human being, a man and a father. I want to break the cycle of my masculine lineage (my father was an alcoholic and his father was an alcoholic who killed himself) and help my son (and daughter!) actualize his (and her!) potential (without having to work through quite so much 💩. lol)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eGive Presence\u003c/strong\u003e. The second thing I shared is also ridiculously obvious: Be present. We ALL (!!!) know that presence is the greatest act of love. Yet… Most of us forget that most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution is astonishingly simple. Put your smartphone in airplane mode in another room when you spend time with your kids (and your spouse and, well, any human). This simple act removes the greatest barrier to our presence and provides the fastest route to both connecting with our kids and modeling the style of connection (see #1 on being an exemplar!) that will be so important for our kids in a more and more hyperconnected (and paradoxically disconnected) world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eEmbrace Challenges\u003c/strong\u003e. The third thing we talked about was the importance of embracing what \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/authors/carol-dweck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCarol Dweck\u003c/a\u003e calls a “Growth Mindset.” I told the guys that her books \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/mindset-carol-dweck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMindset\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/self-theories-carol-dweck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSelf-theories\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e are fantastic and recommended my Notes on them for the quick review.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePractically speaking, I’ve been \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e deliberate in following Dweck’s advice to embrace challenges and always reward EFFORT not “ability.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, on the effort front, I say things like: “Nice trail running!” rather than “You’re a great trail runner!” Or, “I saw how hard you worked to climb up that slide—and that you almost fell then caught yourself and kept on going. Love how hard you tried!” rather than “You’re such a great climber!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the challenges front, Dweck tells us to talk about our own challenges and how we’re facing them and to “rub our hands together” with excitement when things are hard. I’m ALL ABOUT this. I literally rub my hands together any time something is challenging (on the most mundane things) and say, “Oh, wow! I love challenges.” Or when I watch Emerson do something hard—whether that’s build a Lego set or do our Spartan wall traverse—I say, “Ohhhhh!! AWESOME!! That one’s challenging! How fun!!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s almost surreal how much he’s embraced this. He once asked his nanny, “Do you love challenges?

He’s sold over 25 million copies of his dozens of books that have been translated into over 50 languages. His organizations have also trained leaders in EVERY single country around the world. This is his most recent book, written after FIFTY (!) years of leadership. As per the sub-title, John walks us through the “11 Essential Changes” he has made and that he encourages every leader to embrace.

<div class="line-clamp-2">James Clear has a super-popular website (jamesclear.com). Millions of people visit it every month and hundreds of thousands subscribe to his email newsletter. After reading this book, I can see why. He’s a great writer and distills the essence of habit formation into, well, its fundamental components—the “atomic” structure if you will—while showing us how those TINY little incremental improvements add up to MIGHTY results. I rarely say a book is a must-read but this one’s as close as it gets. Big Ideas we explore include: The math behind 1% gains compounding over a year (and a decade!), navigating the Plateau of Latent Potential (ever given up on a habit? Take note!), the importance (and etymology) of our Identity (get this: it *literally* means 'repeated being ness'), The 4 Laws of Behavior Change (remember: cue + craving + response + reward and... make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying), and the Sorites Paradox (can a single habit change your life?).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">BJ Fogg founded the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University. He is one of the world’s leading authorities on the science of behavior change. In this book, he introduces us to the core elements of his Fogg Behavior Model as we learn that habit change doesn’t need to be as hard as we make it. As BJ tells us: “We are not the problem. Our approach to change is. It’s a design flaw—not a personal flaw.” Big Ideas we explore include the three elements that drive behavior (B = MAP!), the ABCs of Tiny Habits (Anchor + (Tiny) Behavior + Celebration!), the power of anchor prompts (After I (ANCHOR), I will (NEW HABIT), and the power of celebration (get your Shine on!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Viktor Frankl survived the horrors of the holocaust and describes his Logotherapy in this classic book. In the Note, we'll explore the fact that our attitudes determine our happiness and that *no one* can ever take away the freedom for us to choose our response to any given situation. We'll also look at the importance of having a mission in life and that as we serve something bigger than ourselves, our happiness and success will follow.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This book combines two of my favorite things: Stoicism + Ryan Holiday’s wisdom. Stoicism was one of the most influential philosophy of the Roman world and has continued to influence many of history’s greatest minds. As Ryan says: It’s time to bring it back as a powerful tool “in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance, and wisdom.” This is one of the my favorite books ever. Big Ideas we explore: the #1 thing to know about Stoicism, how to create tranquility, a good answer to “What’s the latest and greatest?!,” the 2 essential tasks in life and the art of acquiescence (aka amor fati).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Gabriel Oettingen is one of the world’s leading researchers in “The New Science of Motivation.” The basic idea of the book is captured in a clever image on the cover: Rose colored glasses with one lens cracked. Oettingen walks us thru the compelling research that demonstrates the power of seeing both the positive AND the challenges. When we contrast our wishes with the obstacles to their attainment we, almost magically, catalyze an extraordinarily higher level of performance.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Carol Dweck, Ph.D is a Stanford Professor and one of the world’s leading authorities on the science of motivation. She tells us that our “mindset”—how we see the world—determines a *huge* part of our overall happiness and well-being and achievement. In this Note, we’ll explore the difference between a “fixed mindset” and a “growth mindset” and some Big Ideas on why we want to learn how to live from a growth mindset.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Ray Dalio is one of the most successful people alive. In fact, Time magazine says that he’s one of the 100 most influential people on the planet while Fortune magazine tells us his company (Bridgewater Associates) is the 5th most impactful private company in the U.S. and Forbes tells us that he’s one of the 100 wealthiest people on the planet. All of which makes Dalio, to use his words, “believable” when it comes to discussing how to get what we want in life and work. Enter: Principles. Big Ideas we explore: how to evolve, what’s most important, meet the shapers, Principles #1 (Embrace reality and deal with it) + #2 (5-Step process to getting what you want in life), and the two AI’s: Artificial Intelligence + Ancient Intelligence.</div>

<p class="!pb-0">by<!-- --> <span><a class="font-normal text-red transition-colors hover:text-red-700" href="/authors/mel-robbins">Mel Robbins</a></span></p>
<div class="line-clamp-2">Mel Robbins is funny, witty and wise. Her TEDx Talk (called How to stop screwing yourself over) is one of the most popular of all time, with more than 18 million views. This book is also super popular—with over 1,000 Amazon reviews. It’s pretty awesome. Actually, the book is REALLY (!) good. In fact, Mel Robbins’ 5 Second Rule might just be one of THE most elegantly efficient Tools we can use to close the gap between who we’re CAPABLE of being and who we’re ACTUALLY being. (Seriously.) Big Ideas we explore include The 5 Second Rule (and how/when to rock it), how to win the game of life (hint: start, stay in, for the long game!), excitement + anxiety (and how they feel the same in the body), managing distractions (today a good day?), and changing your life with one moment of everyday courage.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Matthew Walker is one of the world’s leading neuroscientists and sleep experts. He’s a professor at UC Berkeley (and former professor at Harvard) who has spent decades studying why we sleep and how to, as per the sub-title of this book, unlock the power of sleep and dreams. As you know if you’ve been following along, I’m a HUGE advocate of Optimizing our sleep as a fundamental practice in Optimizing our lives. This book has made me EVEN MORE bullish about the power of sleep. The consequences of chronically depriving ourselves of the sleep we need? Well, they’re astonishingly devastating—dramatically increasing the odds of having everything from mood disorders to cancer (and everything else we don’t want). Big Ideas we explore include the fact that you're more likely to get struck by lightning than have the gene that let's you get by on less than the recommended sleep, the universality of sleep (even worms sleep!!), resetting baselines, the iPad effect (did you know how much using one before sleep messes w/your melatonin?), and some tips to Optimize your sleep TONIGHT!!!</div>

As I told Alexandra: “I had no idea Marie was THAT awesome!!!” My excuse: I’ve been in hermit-mode and have done nothing but read books for 5 years (no blogs/videos/etc.) so I wasn’t able to get the full sense of Marie’s heroically brilliant and grounded and HILARIOUS power until this book came out. I’ve read and created PhilosophersNotes on well over 500 books. This is one of my ABSOLUTE (!) favorites of all time. I HIGHLY (!!!) recommend it. It’s in the same league as some of my other favorites like Deep Work Atomic Habits and The 5 Second Rule. (In fact, on my chalkboard right now, I actually have “EVERYTHING IS FIGUREOUTABLE” right above “5-4-3-2-1-GO!” ← Winning combo!)

<div class="line-clamp-2">Suzie and James Pawelski are two of the world's leading positive psychology experts. James cofounded the Master of Applied Positive Psychology program at the University of Pennsylvania with Martin Seligman while Suzie is a graduate of the program and a leading freelance writer and consultant. Together they've written an incredible book on "Using the Science of Positive Psychology to Build Love That Lasts." I’ve been waiting for a very long time for the book that would make me say: “READ THIS BOOK if you want to figure out how to integrate Ancient Wisdom + Modern Science + Practical Tools to Optimize your relationship.” And, well, THIS book is it. I HIGHLY recommend it. In fact, it's not only my #1 Love book recommendation, it's also cracked the Top 10 all-time greatest list. Big Ideas we explore include The Relationship Gym (hit it!), Aristotelian Lovers (the REAL Soul Mates), SNAP (James geniuses x2), Know Thy... (self and thy partner!), and Love Is an Action Verb (let's commit to flourishing together TODAY!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I’m a HUGE fan of Phil and Barry's first book, The Tools. Coming Alive is kinda like The Tools Part 2.

Big Ideas we explore include how to connect to our Life Force, defeat Part X (their name for that part of each of us that gets in the way), build our confidence and learn to see problems as gifts as we live a GREAT life.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Carol Dweck is one of the world’s leading researchers on the science of motivation. This book is a collection of brief essays on various aspects of “self-theories.” It’s essentially a bridge between her extensive academic research studies and her popular book Mindset. It’s amazing. Big Ideas we explore include the two frameworks (entity vs. incremental) and their two goals (performance vs. learning), attributional retraining (aka learning the best way to respond to failure!), and moving from contingent self-worth to wholehearted self-esteem.</div>

The most comprehensive and readable look at what we *scientifically know* works to boost our happiness—from gratitude and exercise to optimism and kindness. (btw: The other #1 book I'd recommend? The PhilosophersNotes workbook. How can you beat 1,000 Big Ideas from 100 great books packed into 600 pages? ;)</div>

In this Note, we take a quick look at The Gift that we all have that’s the key to our potential greatness, HOW to go about tapping into the benefits of that gift via a certain type of practice (forget naive practice and go for purposeful + deliberate!), the fact that there is no such thing as a “10,000 Hour Rule,” and why we should be called Homo Exercens rather than Homo Sapiens. :)</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our fourth Note on one of Ryan Holiday’s books. Ryan is one of my absolute favorite writers. One of the testimonials in the front of the book perfectly captures my sentiment. Screenwriter and director Brian Koppelman (Rounders, Ocean’s Thirteen and Billions) puts it this way: “I don’t have many rules in life, but one I never break is: If Ryan Holiday writes a book, I read it as soon as I can get my hands on it.” (btw: Cal Newport’s the first testimonial. He says: “Some authors give advice. Ryan Holiday distills wisdom. This book is a must read.”) Penguin Random House sent me an advance copy of this book. As I knew it would be: It’s fantastic.

<div class="line-clamp-2">I planned to read this book since Cal Newport referenced it in Deep Work. I finally did so in preparation to teach Productivity 101. It’s fantastic. If you’re a business leader or entrepreneur I think you’ll particularly enjoy it. Big Ideas we cover include the 4DX, the whirlwind, your Wildly Important Goals, Lag vs. Lead measures, the power of keeping score, and avoiding the blackhole of the magnificently trivial.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Michael Gelb profiles the seven attributes of da Vinci's genius in his great book and in our Note we'll have fun checking out some Big Ideas including one of the most powerful exercises I've ever done called "A Hundred Questions." The exercise literally shaped my life and I trust you'll dig it as much as I have. We'll also look at the power of affirmations (did you know da Vinci used them?!) and the body of a genius (did you know da Vinci was also an exceptional athlete?!). Fun stuff.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Aristotle's writings have been extraordinarily influential since ancient times. This treatise is named after his son and is a collection of his lecture notes--imagining attending his Lyceum and listening to him teach 2,300 years ago! Of course, it's packed with culture-changing Big Ideas. Some of my favorites we cover include the ultimate end: eudaimonic happiness (vs. "happiness" as most of us think about it!), how to achieve that eudaimonia (hint: "virtuous activity of the soul" aka areté), how to win the Olympic Games (hint: you can't just show up; you need to ACT!), the doctrine of the mean (and the vice of deficiency + excess) and the virtue of magnanimity: meet YOUR great soul.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jocko Willink and Leif Babin were two of the most senior (and decorated) SEALS on the ground in the most intense battles of Iraq. In this book they share their leadership lessons on how U.S. Navy SEALs lead and win. It’s an intense, impactful read. Big Ideas we explore include a definition of Extreme Ownership, the fact that there are no bad teams, only bad leaders, how to prioritize and execute and remembering that discipline = freedom.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Dale Carnegie wrote this book in 1937. The publisher originally only printed 5,000 copies. It was an immediate best seller and went on to sell over 30 million copies. I’ve always had a very strong allergy to the idea of “networking” and trying to “win friends” and/or “influence people” so this one never quite resonated but I loved it. It’s packed with Big Ideas on how to Optimize our relationships and, perhaps in the process, win some more friends and influence some people as better humans and leaders. We explore: The #1 indispensable quality you need for Optimizing, Principle #1 of How to Win Friends (Never criticize!!), how to make a great first impression, the Golden Rule (you living it), what to do when you make a mistake, and what to think when you meet people today!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Seneca was an old-school Roman statesman and one of history’s leading Stoic philosophers. In this book he tells us that life is only short if you don’t know how to use it and also gives us some tips on how to deal with challenging times and cultivate tranquility. Big Ideas we explore include making T.O.D.A.Y. the day, how to deal with being exiled (never know when it could happen ;), and why flexibility is the virtuous road to tranquility (and how to avoid the detours).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">David Brooks is one of the nations’ leading writers and commentators. He is an op-ed columnist for the New York Times and appears regularly on PBS NewsHour and Meet the Press. I loved his book The Road to Character. I loved this one even more. David tells us there are two mountains: The first mountain? That’s what society tells us we should pursue: all the normal trappings of success. The second mountain? That’s where the magic (and joy!) exists: where we move beyond ourselves and COMMIT (important word for this book!) to giving ourselves most fully to something bigger than ourselves. David identifies four potential commitments: to our families, to our vocations, to our faith/philosophy of life and to our communities. Ultimately, the book is intended to be a guide to the ULTIMATE quest in life: “The Quest for a Moral Life.”</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Cal Newport is one of my favorite thinkers. He got his Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT and is now a Professor at Georgetown. He’s also a bestselling author of a number of books. Given the fact that the fastest way to Optimize your life is to STOP doing things that are sub-optimal AND the fact that (for nearly all of us) our use of technology is the #1 thing that “Needs work!,” it’s SUPER important for us to figure out how to best use all the technology available to us WITHOUT becoming lost in a tsunami of inputs. Enter: Our new philosophy of technology use: Digital Minimalism. Enter: My SUPER strong recommendation of the book and my ALL IN commitment to helping create a movement around the ideas in the book. As you know, I rarely say a book is a must read but this book is as close as it gets. Big Ideas we explore include the fact that your soul is engaged in a lopsided arms race, a definition + overview of digital minimalism, the importance of spending time alone (and the consequences of *not* spending adequate time alone), reclaiming leisure (get active!) and joining the Attention Resistance. Here's to Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Did you know there’s an equation for Procrastination? Yep. Expectancy x Value / Impulsiveness x Delay = Motivation. Thank you, Piers Steel. In this great book, Piers (a leading researcher on the science of motivation/procrastination) walks us thru the power of that equation. Big Ideas we explore include: Mental Contrasting (and why it beats creative visualization), goal setting (3 scientific keys) and how to add a month of productivity to your year.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I’m grateful for Robert Emmons. He’s dedicated the last three decades of his life to understanding the science of how to boost our well-being. In the process, he’s conducted ground-breaking research on the power of gratitude. In fact, he’s basically THE researcher we have to thank for understanding *just* how powerful gratitude journaling is. (He's also served as editor-in-chief of The Journal of Positive Psychology.) I consider myself a reasonably grateful guy but this book has opened my eyes to JUST how powerful gratitude is. And, to just how important it is to DELIBERATELY PRACTICE it. Big Ideas we explore include: How to give yourself a 25% (!!!) boost in happiness, the top gratitude practices, the #1 obstacle to gratitude (and its remedy), and using challenges for grateful fuel!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jordan Peterson is one of the world's leading intellectuals. He's a Canadian clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Toronto. (Before that, he taught at Harvard.) He’s published over 100 scientific articles and he’s super-popular on YouTube. This book is wonderfully intense and equally thoughtful. Peterson’s integration of everything from evolutionary psychology, politics, religion and morality is astounding. After taking a super-quick look at all 12 Rules, Big Ideas we cover include the importance of mastering the flow or Order + Chaos (and why RULES are so important), Rule #1 (stand up straight, shoulders back! Remember lobsters...), Rule #2 (Treat yourself better! Remember pets...), Rule #6: Clean up your life (remember to start stopping...), and the fact that your Being is in your Becoming (which is connected to Rule #4...).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This book is amazing. If you’ve ever struggled with rockin’ your creativity it’s pretty much a must-read. Written in an intense, no-nonsense style, Pressfield gets to the heart of the “Resistance” that stands in our way to fully expressing ourselves as he challenges us to become true “Professionals.” In the Note, we’ll check out some of my Favorite Big Ideas—from letting the results be by-products to the importance of simply sitting down and trying day after day after day.</div>

Use a checklist. Sounds too silly to work but… It does. Period. Big Ideas we explore include two reasons we err (ignorance + ineptitude), what to do about it (checklists!), how to reduce your Masterpiece Day mortality rate by at least 47% (checklists!), why Van Halen doesn’t like brown M&amp;M’s (checklists!), and your Big 3 Keystone Initiative (checklist!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Patrick McKeown is one of the world’s leading teachers of the Buteyko Breathing Method which was created in the 1950s by a Russian doctor named Dr. Konstantin Buteyko. McKeown suffered from asthma for decades until he found the Buteyko Method. At which point, he reversed his asthma symptoms and then dedicated his life to helping others optimize their breathing. In this book, he extends the Buteyko Method into an approach he calls the Oxygen Advantage. Big Ideas we cover include the #1 obstacle to optimal breathing, Oxygen Delivery 101, the #1 breathing tip, and how to dial in your sleep.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Ready to upgrade your vision of love? Then you’re in for a treat with this fantastic book by Barbara Fredrickson. Barbara is one of the world’s leading positive psychologists. The book is incredibly well-written, deeply inspiring and incredibly practical as well. In fact, I just told Alexandra that this book might be the one that most positively impacts my life. Big Ideas we explore include: Love 1.0 vs. Love 2.0, taking a trip to Vagus, identifying our prevailing desire, #1 tip: create 3 loving moments today, exiting our cocoon of self-absorption via loving-kindness meditation, and Love 2.0 x 2: compassionate + celebratory love.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">The Alter Ego Effect. This is one of the most fun and compelling and inspiring books I’ve read in awhile. I REALLY (!!!) enjoyed reading it, had a ton of fun constructing and playing with some potential Alter Egos and highly recommend it. I also really enjoyed how high-performance coach and mental game strategist Todd Herman describes the science behind the power of “secret identities” to transform our lives and I loved the parallels between his perspective and our Big 3 Identities &gt; Virtues &gt; Behaviors model. Big Ideas we explore include Superman + Clark Kent (who's who?), activating your Heroic Self (the science of), motivation and emotion (share a common Latin root), virtues as super powers (more on the science of), and Crossing the Threshold (Today the day?).</div>

Big Ideas we explore include: defining ego, becoming more than a flash in the pan, finally answering the question of whether it takes 10,000 or 20,000 hours to attain mastery, the virtue and value of staying true to your own path and making it rather than faking it.</div>

In fact, in their *great* book, Willpower, Roy Baumeister (one of the world’s leading scientific researchers on self-control) and John Tierney (science writer for the New York Times) tell us that “Improving willpower is the surest way to a better life.” In this Note, we’ll learn how to eat our way to willpower (seriously), how to exercise our self-control muscles, why “precommitment” is so important and how to win the willpower game with bright lines and a great offense. :)</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Got problems with your soul? These days, you’d see a psychotherapist. But, back in the day, it was the philosopher who’d help you optimize—they were the preferred physician of the soul. This book is about the philosophical roots of modern psychotherapy. Specifically, it outlines the connection between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and Stoicism. Big Ideas we explore include being a warrior of the mind vs. a librarian of the mind, your highest human purpose, getting on good terms with your inner daimon, practicing the reserve clause and modeling your ideal sage.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">The Tao te Ching. It's the core text of Taoism and one of the top old school classics of all time. In this Note, we'll take a look at everything from making use of solitude to the fact that the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step (heard that before, eh?!). We'll also learn to let go of our attachment to future results and gracefully roll with the ebbs and flows of life.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Alexandra got this book for me after I told her how much I loved David Brooks’ The Second Mountain. Apparently it is recommended alongside that book on Amazon. With 1,400+ reviews, Alexandra thought I might like it. Not only did I like the book, I loved it. And, I fell in love with Richard Rohr. Father Rohr is a Franciscan priest who beautifully integrates his faith with wisdom from various perspectives. Big Ideas we explore include our main Job in life (remembering that we're light bulbs and staying screwed in!), life's two major tasks, the fact that the way UP is DOWN (hence, the title of the book: Falling Upward), the hero and the heroine and their journeys, the paradox of the ego ("You ironically need a very strong ego structure to let go of your ego"), and how to become a Serene Disciple (let God drive).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">David Goggins is a former Navy SEAL (and Army Ranger) who used to hold a Guinness World Record for completing 4,030 pull-ups in 17 hours. These days he’s setting records as an ultra-endurance athlete. But he wasn’t always Mr. Superhero. In this great autobiographical self-help book, David walks us through his transformation from being a 297-pound exterminator to a “Who IS this guy?!” superhero. If you’re into SUPER (!!!) intense demonstrations of how to conquer ourselves to do the seemingly impossible (and don’t mind a stream of f-bombs—lol) then I think you’ll love this book as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include: The Accountability Mirror, bringing your best (when you feel the worst), hero callouses (let failures toughen you up!), the process (how to go from running 1/4 of a mile to 200+ nonstop), and bursting from the inside out (learn to endure!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">John Maxwell is one of the world’s leading authorities on leadership. He’s trained millions (literally) of leaders and has written over 50 (!) books that have sold over 13 million copies—this one alone has sold over 3 million copies. After a super quick look at the 21 Laws, Big Ideas we explore: The Law of Process (aka: Leaders are learners), the foundation of leadership (= trust), leaders are practical AND visionary, the law of victory (!), and your legacy—what will people say when you die? + What’s your “life sentence”?</div>

So, when I saw this book I immediately got it and read it and here we are. Paul Napper and Anthony Rao are leading consultants and clinicians (who have both held academic positions at Harvard Medical School). In their great book, they define agency as “the ability to act as an effective agent for yourself—reflecting, making creative choices, and constructing a meaningful life.” Then they provide practical, scientifically-grounded wisdom on, as per the sub-title of the book: “The 7 Principles to Conquer Obstacles, Make Effective Decisions, and Create a Life on Your Own Terms.” In this Note, we take a quick look at the 7 principles and shine a spotlight on the first 3 with a focus on how we can Optimize our agency TODAY!!</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">William B. Irvine is a professor of philosophy at Wright State University. He’s also a fantastic (and prolific) writer. And… Unlike many of his academic, professor-of-philosophy peers, he is a practicing Stoic philosopher. In the words of Donald Robertson (another Stoic author and practitioner; see The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), he is both a librarian AND a warrior of the mind. We featured another one of Professor Irvine’s great books on Stoicism called A Guide to the Good Life. I enjoyed that one quite a bit but I REALLY (!) enjoyed this one. Like, jumbo loved it. In fact, I’m going to put this one right at the top of our growing collection of books on Stoicism—along with the must-read classics by Aurelius (Meditations), Seneca (Letters from a Stoic, On the Shortness of Life), and Epictetus (Discourses, Enchiridion) plus the modern classics like Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is the Way and The Daily Stoic.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Nir Eyal is a former lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. His first book was an international bestseller that’s influenced the product development of pretty much all of the leading tech companies on the planet. It was called Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. We have Nir to thank for helping make the technology we use better. And... As he says, “But there’s also a dark side. As philosopher Paul Virilio wrote, ‘When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck.’ In the case of user-friendly products and services, what makes some products engaging and easy to use can also make them distracting.” After finding HIMSELF hooked to many of the products created by designers inspired by *his* work, Eyal got himself UNHOOKED and, ultimately INDISTRACTABLE. In this great book, he gives us a practical look at *why* we’re so vulnerable to getting hooked in the first place and, most importantly, how to make ourselves Indistractable so we can control our attention and choose our lives.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Trevor Moawad is a mental conditioning coach to elite performers. He is well known for being the mental coach to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and has worked closely with prestigious NCAA football programs and coaches, the US Special Operations community, Major League Baseball, and the NBA. This book is, as per the sub-title, all about “How to Think Neutrally and Gain Control of Your Life.” I loved it and, if you’re also equally fired up by the mental toughness in sports and life genre, I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did. Big Ideas we explore include neutral thinking (much better than positive or negative), goats and G.O.A.T.s, the law of substitution (focus!), the illusion of choice (if you’re REALLY ALL IN, there is no choice), and drawing a line in the dirt (and getting to it… again and again and again!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I’m a big fan of Kelly McGonigal and her ability to help us apply scientific wisdom to our lives. We’ve covered two of her earlier books: The Willpower Instinct and The Upside of Stress. So... When I got this book, knew I’d enjoy it. But, I didn’t anticipate JUST how much I’d love it. We have some great Notes on Movement (Spark, Spartan Up and No Sweat among my favorites), but Kelly’s book will be our new go-to for the science of WHY exercise/movement is so essential to our well-being. It’s PHENOMENAL. Reading about the SCIENCE behind stories of transformation (and how, as per the sub-title of her book: “Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage”) also made me that much more clear on the power of what we’re doing with all of our work and the importance of focusing so much on Energy (especially with our Mastery and Coach programs). Big Ideas we explore include: Hope Molecules (and how to create them), persistence highs (and how to create them), collective effervescence (and why it's so awesome), how we endure (hint: TOGETHER!), and OMMS!!! (Obstacles (literally!) Make Me Stronger!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Admiral William H. McRaven is a Retired U.S. Navy SEAL who served for thirty-seven years and commanded at every level. As a Four-Star Admiral, his final assignment was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces. (During this time, he oversaw the covert mission that killed Osama bin Laden.) In 2014, he gave the commencement address to the graduates of the University of Texas at Austin. Millions of people wound up watching his speech on ten lessons he learned from his Navy SEAL training. This book takes a deeper look at those ten lessons. It’s a super-quick read—packed with simple, yet profound wisdom along with moving stories of moral exemplars. It's FANTASTIC.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jim Kwik is a widely recognized world expert in memory improvement, brain optimization and accelerated learning and has “served as the brain coach to a who’s who of Hollywood’s elite, professional athletes, political leaders, and business magnates.” The best part of Jim’s story? After suffering a brain injury in kindergarten, he was described by a teacher as "the kid with a broken brain.” He struggled with learning for most of his life. Then he went antifragile on it and studied (and applied!) the science of how we learn. Fast-forward a couple decades and VOILA. Here we are. This book is REALLY (!) good. Big Ideas we explore include the Limitless Model (Mindset + Motivation + Methods), Supervillans (Digital: Deluge + Distraction + Dementia + Deduction + Depression), Learn FASTER (Forget + Act + State + Teach + Enter + Review), Learned Limitlessness (delete the LIEs and Optimize the BS!), and how to create sustainable Motivation (Purpose x Energy x Small Simple Steps).</div>

Big Ideas we explore include The Two Wolves (which one are YOU feeding?), the. 7 Commitments (Courage + Trust + Respect + Growth + Excellence + Resiliency + Alignment), Falling Down Seven Times (and getting back up eight), Semper Gumby (Always Flexible!), and Your #1 Fear to Stare Down Next (what's yours?).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Donald Robertson is one of the world’s leading thinkers, writers AND practitioners of Stoic philosophy. He’s also a therapist who integrates Stoicism into his work with individuals. This is our second Note on one of his great books. The first Note was on The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in which he connects the philosophical underpinnings of CBT (one of the most empirically-validated, effective modern therapies) to ancient Stoicism. This book is part biography and part philosophy. It’s all awesome. If you want to know how to think like a Roman emperor, start here. I think you’ll enjoy the book as much as I did.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Jocko Willink is a retired Navy SEAL. He was commander of Task Unit Bruiser―the most decorated Special Operations Unit of the Iraq War. I really enjoyed Jocko’s first book Extreme Ownership and I knew this one would be good but... I didn’t expect it to be THIS good. The words literally explode off the page. Not just because each micro-chapter was an incredibly inspiring micro-manifesto but because each word was written by a man so clearly living in complete integrity with his deepest values. John Maxwell would say his “moral authority” is extraordinary. I’d say his SOUL FORCE is palpable.

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is our 4th Note on one of John Maxwell’s books. We also have Notes on The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth, and How Successful People Think. John is one of my absolute favorite writers and teachers. His books are *ridiculously* packed with Big Ideas. (Like, jumbo-ridiculously packed with practical wisdom.) As we’ve discussed, he’s one of the world’s leading authorities on leadership. He’s sold over 25 million copies of his dozens of books that have been translated into over 50 languages. His organizations have also trained leaders in EVERY single country around the world. This is his most recent book, written after FIFTY (!) years of leadership. As per the sub-title, John walks us through the “11 Essential Changes” he has made and that he encourages every leader to embrace. Big Ideas we explore include a quick look at the 11 essential leadershifts, layered learning (compound those +1s!), consistency (how to pay the price of leadership), moral authority (the highest form of leadership!), and the Clock + the Compass (how to fulfill your destiny TODAY).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">I created this class after my friend Matt McCall (who helps run the Pritzker Group Venture Capital fund) asked me to do a talk for 60 of their portfolio CEOs. He was thinking “Optimizing for Supheroes 101.” I loved that idea and decided it would be the perfect context to share my absolute best stuff and here we are. 🤓


In this extra-long class, we start by connecting “Optimizing” and “Hērō” to their ancient Greek philosophical roots then we proceed to walk thru how to go about integrating ancient wisdom, modern science and practical tools to harness our soul force to build strength for two such that we can create our best, most heroic lives.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">“Algorithm.” Yuval Noah Harari tells us that it is the most important concept of the 21st century and that “we should make every effort to understand what an algorithm is, and how algorithms are connected with emotions.” Ray Dalio echoes this perspective and tells us that algorithms will be the most important language for us (and our kids) to learn. Psychologists have been talking about algorithms for awhile as well. They call them “if-then implementation intentions”—which are the secret sauce to using your willpower wisely to install habits that run on autopilot. In this class, we tie that all together and then talk about some practical ways to apply that wisdom to our lives so we can program ourselves wisely and have fun seeing just how awesome we can make our lives. 🤓</div>

If you’ve been shocked by life and learned to curl up in a ball, you’ve given up your power and that leads to places we don’t want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolution: LEARN OPTIMISM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnter: \u003cstrong\u003eThe 3 P’s of Optimism: Permanence + Pervasiveness + Personalization\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the super quick look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePermanence.\u003c/strong\u003e Let’s say something challenging happens. The Optimist will say, “Bring it on. I’ll crush it and then it will pass.” The Pessimist, on the other hand, says, “Gah. Another challenge. This is always going to suck.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, when something GOOD happens, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/lets-try-to-be-optimists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eOptimist\u003c/a\u003e and the Pessimist flip their orientations. The Pessimist, who was sure the bad thing would be permanent, thinks the \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e thing will be fleeting. And, vice-versa with the Optimist. Good thing?

If a bad thing happens, an Optimist is more likely to see the environmental circumstances that might’ve led to the event occurring while the Pessimist will take it all personally. Of course, the Optimist will have a healthy level of “needs work!” ownership when appropriate, but they won’t beat themselves up unnecessarily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, again, the opposite happens with the good stuff.

I’m going to say that again for dramatic effect. A deep meditation is no better for you than a shallow meditation. I am defining a deep meditation as one in which time passes quickly, you have few thoughts, and you generally enjoy the sitting. In a shallow meditation, the time may pass more slowly, you may feel like you are just sitting there having thoughts the whole time, and you may not enjoy the sitting itself. Both are beneficial for you. A deep meditation means the body is getting deep rest; a shallow meditation means the body is releasing stresses in the form of thoughts. One is not better for you than the other. Write it on your mirror, make a T-shirt, tattoo it on your forehead.

Even Gawande himself, a highly trained surgeon with years of operating experience, found that his own performance improved notably after he started using the checklist. His point is that surgery, like any complex task, requires a regular check of all the fundamentals—to liberate the team to focus on the work and any unexpected circumstances that may arise.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat surgical checklist was crazy simple.

An undefeated mind isn’t one that never feels discouraged or despairing; it’s one that continues on in spite of it. Even when we can’t find a smile to save us, even when we’re tired beyond all endurance, possessing an undefeated mind means never forgetting that defeat comes not from failing but from giving up. An undefeated mind doesn’t fill itself with false hope, but with hopes to find real solutions, even solutions it may not want or like.

Victory may not be promised to any of us, but possessing an undefeated mind means behaving as though it is, as though to win we only need to wage an all-out struggle and work harder than everyone else, trying everything we can, and when that fails trying everything we think we can’t, in full understanding that we have no one on whom we can rely for victory but ourselves. Possessing an undefeated mind, we understand that there’s no obstacle from which we can’t create some kind of value. We view any such doubt as delusion.

PRESENCE. In fact, Stanford’s Emma Seppälä tells us: “Charisma, simply put, is absolute presence.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAbsolute presence\u003c/em\u003e.

Don’t be the person constantly checking your phone for the latest push notification. You know what that tells the person you’re with? That you just don’t care that much about them. And, that’s a great way to kill all connection and charisma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Another pro tip: Make eye contact.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur second facet of charisma? Power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresence is the first step, but, according to Cabane, it’s not enough by itself. People are constantly, subconsciously detecting power or a lack thereof. Therefore, if we want to dial up our charisma, we need to dial up our personal power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEasiest way to do that? Your body language. Stand tall, breathe deeply, smile. And, while you’re at it, another great, quick way to boost your power before an interaction is to recall a prior success. Visualize it. FEEL the power you had when you crushed it. Soak THAT in, smile and go connect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third facet of charisma? Warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe may be present and powerful but if the person with whom we’re interacting doesn’t think we’ll use that power for their good then… no charisma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… Dial up your presence and your power AND your warmth.

Practical wisdom allows us to make decisions that improve our eudaimonia, the (ethically) good life. Courage can be physical, but more broadly refers to the moral aspect—for instance, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances… Temperance makes it possible for us to control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to excesses. Justice, for Socrates and the Stoics, refers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: That’s from Part II of the book: “How to Behave in the World.” The short answer on how to behave? It’s revealed in the title of the first chapter from this section: “It’s All About Character (and Virtue).”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMassimo thoughtfully walks us through the four cardinal Stoic virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe tells us: \u003cem\u003e“The Stoics derived their understanding of virtue from Socrates, who believed that all virtues are actually different aspects of the same underlying feature: wisdom. The reason why wisdom is the ‘chief good,’ according to Socrates, is rather simple: it is the only human ability that is good under every and all circumstance.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also connects these four cardinal virtues to the modern Positive Psychology movement which was founded on an exploration of shared virtues among all cultures—which I found particularly awesome because the next book on my stack to read is called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/the-power-of-character-strengths-robert-mcgrath-ryan-niemiec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Power of Character Strengths\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and was written by two of the leading scientists behind the VIA Institute on Character.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMassimo says: \u003cem\u003e“Other cultures have developed, more or less independently, their own sets of virtues as socially important character traits, each arriving at its own classification of the relations among virtues. Interestingly, though, there is much more convergence than we would expect in these days when cultural relativism is so often portrayed as the norm. A study by Katherine Dahlsgaard, Christopher Peterson, and Martin Seligman looked at how virtue is articulated in Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, and what they call ‘Athenian philosophy’ (mostly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). They found a rather surprising amount of congruence among all of these religious-philosophical traditions and identified a set of six ‘core’ virtues: Courage, Justice, Humanity, Temperance, Wisdom, and Transcendence.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFour of the six are indistinguishable from the Stoic virtues. Stoics also accepted the importance of ‘humanity’ and ‘transcendence,’ although they didn’t think of these as virtues, but rather as attitudes toward others (humanity) and toward the universe at large (transcendence).”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo recap and drop it into our Heroic framework.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Stoics had their four cardinal virtues: Wisdom + Courage + Temperance + Justice. Modern scientists looked across a range of religious-philosophical doctrines across a range of cultures and found the same four virtues and added two: Humanity + Transcendence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think we can all agree that Wisdom + Courage + Temperance (or, as I prefer, Self-Mastery) are essential. Then, as we briefly discussed in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/musonius-rufus-musonius-rufus-cynthia-arrieu-king-william-irvine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eNote on Musonius Rufus\u003c/a\u003e, I think “Justice” is a very weak word to capture the LOVE the Stoics (and all other traditions) encouraged us to feel for their families, communities and world. So, why not just call the fourth virtue “Love”? Then we can throw the scientist’s “Justice” and “Humanity” under that umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow we have Wisdom + Self-Mastery + Courage + Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo run it through our Heroic model: We start by having Wisdom. We know the game we’re playing (eudaimonia!) AND, very importantly, how to play it well (operationalize virtue!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we cultivate our Self-Mastery (with an emphasis on the fundamentals so we can Optimize our Energy). Why? So we can more consistently live with both Courage (in all aspects of our lives but with an emphasis on Work) and so we can more consistently live with Love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we do the hard work of operationalizing virtue, we make progress in closing the gap between who we are \u003cem\u003ecapable\u003c/em\u003e of being and who we are \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e being—more and more consistently living with eudaimonia and expressing the Optimus-best version of ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat leads us to Transcendence. From my vantage point, the eudaimonically-best version of ourselves naturally (almost \u003cem\u003eeffervescently\u003c/em\u003e) transcends self-interest and lives a life committed to more than just themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Greek word for that? Hērōs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe become modern, everyday “protectors” of our families and communities and world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have strength for two.

Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur.

This book illustrates how leaders can—indeed must—be disciplined people who create the quiet space for disciplined thought and summon the strength for disciplined action. It is a message needed now more than ever, else we run the risk of waking up at the end of the year having accomplished little of significance, each year slipping by in a flurry of activity pointing nowhere.

He had a 5-year-old like me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen another guy who was also waiting to chat stepped up and said, “Yah. I’d love to hear your thoughts on that.

I actually get tears in my eyes as I think about that.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, I briefly told them about the etymology of the word “parent.” As we discussed in \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/plus-one/bring-forth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis +1\u003c/a\u003e, the word \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e means “to bring forth.” Our primary job as parents is to simply help \u003cem\u003ebring forth\u003c/em\u003e the latent potential (genius!!) that is inherently within our kids.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I shared three things that I think are the most powerful ways to help “bring forth” that awesomeness. Here they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eBe an Exemplar\u003c/strong\u003e. It’s a truism (because it’s true!!), but kids don’t listen to what we tell them to do, they model what we ACTUALLY do. Therefore, by far, the most important thing we can do for our kids is to be a shining, radiant demonstration of what we hope they will aspire to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ebtw: This is, by far, my greatest motivation as a human being, a man and a father. I want to break the cycle of my masculine lineage (my father was an alcoholic and his father was an alcoholic who killed himself) and help my son (and daughter!) actualize his (and her!) potential (without having to work through quite so much 💩. lol)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eGive Presence\u003c/strong\u003e. The second thing I shared is also ridiculously obvious: Be present. We ALL (!!!) know that presence is the greatest act of love. Yet… Most of us forget that most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution is astonishingly simple. Put your smartphone in airplane mode in another room when you spend time with your kids (and your spouse and, well, any human). This simple act removes the greatest barrier to our presence and provides the fastest route to both connecting with our kids and modeling the style of connection (see #1 on being an exemplar!) that will be so important for our kids in a more and more hyperconnected (and paradoxically disconnected) world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eEmbrace Challenges\u003c/strong\u003e.

Love how hard you tried!” rather than “You’re such a great climber!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the challenges front, Dweck tells us to talk about our own challenges and how we’re facing them and to “rub our hands together” with excitement when things are hard. I’m ALL ABOUT this. I literally rub my hands together any time something is challenging (on the most mundane things) and say, “Oh, wow! I love challenges.” Or when I watch Emerson do something hard—whether that’s build a Lego set or do our Spartan wall traverse—I say, “Ohhhhh!! AWESOME!! That one’s challenging!
