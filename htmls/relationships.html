Big Ideas we cover: The Big 3 of charisma: Presence + Power + Warmth (and how to boost each), what gets in the way (and what to do about it), the power of visualization (#1 tip) and more.","title":"The Charisma Myth","pnSubtitle":"How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism","slug":"the-charisma-myth-olivia-fox-cabane","authorizationState":"FREECONTENT","authorDetails":[{"__typename":"Author","id":"2766","slug":"olivia-fox-cabane","authorName":"Olivia Fox Cabane","imageUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/authors/headshots/olivia-fox-cabane.png","tagline":"Columnist, keynote speaker and coach to the leadership of Fortune 500 companies.","contentType":"AUTHOR"}],"coverImage":"https://assets.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/book-covers/the-charisma-myth-cover.png","contentType":"PHILOSOPHERNOTE","library":{"__typename":"Library","saved":false,"completed":false,"faved":false}},{"__typename":"PlusOne","id":"34221","authorizationState":"ANONYMOUS","contentType":"PLUSONE","audioUrl":"https://assets.heroic.us/plus-one/downloads/mp3s/files/Optimize-0134-falling-in-love-vs-standing-in-love.mp3","number":134,"intro":"It’s pretty easy to FALL in love.

Watching Humphrey Bogart gather teary-eyed Ingrid Bergman into his arms may make your heart pound, but real-life romance is fueled by far more humdrum scenes. It is kept alive each time you let your spouse know he or she is valued during the grind of everyday life. In marriage, couples are always making what I call ‘bids’ for each other’s attention, affection, humor, or support. Bids can be as minor as asking for a backrub or as significant as seeking help in carrying the burden when an aging parent is ill. The partner responds to each bid either by turning toward the spouse or turning away. A tendency to turn toward your partner is the basis of trust, emotional connection, passion, and a satisfying sex life. Comical as it may sound, romance is strengthened in the supermarket aisle when your partner asks, ‘Are we out of butter?’ and you answer, ‘I don’t know. Let me go get some just in case,’ instead of shrugging apathetically. It grows when you know your spouse is having a bad day at work and you take a few seconds out of your schedule to send him an encouraging text. In all of these instances, partners are making a choice to turn toward rather than away.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Turning toward” our partner instead of away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGottman tells us that our partners are always making “bids” for our attention. Whether we accept their invitation to connect or not is one of the greatest predictors of the longevity of our relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet this: Gottman did a 6-year follow-up study of newlyweds.

She wrote a book called \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroic.us/philosophers-notes/love-2-0-barbara-fredrickson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLove 2.0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e where she tells us that, from a scientific perspective, love is really all about “micro-moments of positivity”–moments in our everyday lives in which we connect with someone over a shared positive emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll talk about that more soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, I want to focus on two different types of love: compassionate love and celebratory love. Compassionate love is when our hearts open up to feel someone’s pain and we wish them a sense of well-being. Celebratory love is, as the name implies, when we see the awesomeness in someone else and CELEBRATE it with them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarbara calls celebratory love “gratitude’s generous cousin.” (← I love that.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe appreciate SOMEONE ELSE’S good fortune when we practice (yes, it’s a practice!) celebratory love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can do this all day every day. See someone with a spring in their step and a smile on their face? Take a moment to celebrate their apparent happiness and beam them a silent, virtual high five! Barbara silently says to herself, “May your happiness and good fortune continue!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, perhaps most importantly, when a loved one (or friend or colleague or anyone) shares a story about their success with you, CELEBRATE IT!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarbara tells us that most counseling focuses on helping couples and families deal with the challenges in their relationships. But, she tells us, it’s actually WAY more important to get REALLY good at celebrating the POSITIVE stuff!! (If we can’t do \u003cem\u003ethat,\u003c/em\u003e our relationship is \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e in trouble.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s move from theory to practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpend a moment thinking of the three people you love most in the world.

One of the important things he says we need to address is “Community.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the chapter he dedicates to “Community,” Yuval makes some very powerful points. One of the most simple yet powerful distinctions he makes is the fact that \u003cem\u003e“Humans have bodies.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, that’s not a newsflash but it’s remarkable how easily we can forget that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe continues by saying, \u003cem\u003e“During the last century technology has been distancing us from our bodies. We have been losing our ability to pay attention to what we smell and taste. \u003c/em\u003eInstead\u003cem\u003e we are absorbed in our smartphones and computers.

<div class="line-clamp-2">Suzie and James Pawelski are two of the world's leading positive psychology experts. James cofounded the Master of Applied Positive Psychology program at the University of Pennsylvania with Martin Seligman while Suzie is a graduate of the program and a leading freelance writer and consultant. Together they've written an incredible book on "Using the Science of Positive Psychology to Build Love That Lasts." I’ve been waiting for a very long time for the book that would make me say: “READ THIS BOOK if you want to figure out how to integrate Ancient Wisdom + Modern Science + Practical Tools to Optimize your relationship.” And, well, THIS book is it. I HIGHLY recommend it. In fact, it's not only my #1 Love book recommendation, it's also cracked the Top 10 all-time greatest list. Big Ideas we explore include The Relationship Gym (hit it!), Aristotelian Lovers (the REAL Soul Mates), SNAP (James geniuses x2), Know Thy... (self and thy partner!), and Love Is an Action Verb (let's commit to flourishing together TODAY!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">The Doctor of Love is in da house! In this Note, we'll explore some of Buscaglia's Big Ideas on how to live with a lotta Love— starting with the fact that if we want to master the subject, we've gotta *study* it! We'll also look at how important it is to fully express ourselves and that a truly loving relationship is one in which both partners are committed to their own growth and supporting their love's growth. (P.S. My Goddess was the first chica I'd met who'd read this book and I think I fell in love on our 1st date when she told me she loved it, too!)</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Ready to upgrade your vision of love? Then you’re in for a treat with this fantastic book by Barbara Fredrickson. Barbara is one of the world’s leading positive psychologists. The book is incredibly well-written, deeply inspiring and incredibly practical as well. In fact, I just told Alexandra that this book might be the one that most positively impacts my life. Big Ideas we explore include: Love 1.0 vs. Love 2.0, taking a trip to Vagus, identifying our prevailing desire, #1 tip: create 3 loving moments today, exiting our cocoon of self-absorption via loving-kindness meditation, and Love 2.0 x 2: compassionate + celebratory love.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Erich Fromm, a leading 20th century psychologist, tells us that love is an art--and that if we want to master love then we need to study it like we would any other art we want to master. In this Note, we’ll explore some Big Ideas on how to rock both the theory and the practice of love. Big Ideas include moving from “falling in” love to “STANDING in” love plus the need to get rid of the illusions of a perfect relationship.

<p class="!pb-0">by<!-- --> <span><a class="font-normal text-red transition-colors hover:text-red-700" href="/authors/anthony-de-mello">Anthony de Mello</a></span></p>
<div class="line-clamp-2">This is a tiny little pocket book featuring thirty-one inspiring, challenging meditations on how to love by Anthony de Mello, a mystical Jesuit priest who also wrote the great book Awareness that we cover. The book is a powerful, challenging look at how to break free from our conditioning, reprogram our minds and truly love. Big Ideas we explore include what it means to love, enjoying the symphony of life (by no longer clinging or renouncing), the art of looking (How are you THAT?), how to create freedom to make a fool of yourself, plus effort, effortlessness and fun.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Brené Brown is one of the world’s most beloved teachers. We’ve covered two of her other #1 NY Times bestselling books: Daring Greatly and The Gifts of Imperfection. This book is all about helping us navigate our quests for true belonging—that sense of connection to yourself and to others that’s authentic, vulnerable, and courageous. First step: We need to know that it requires a trip into the hero’s forest of the unknown. Which demands “braving the wilderness.” Big Ideas we explore include deepening our understanding of that quest to true belonging, embracing paradox, the 4 practices of true belonging, how to deal with life’s challenges, and writing yourself a permission slip to be YOU.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Dale Carnegie wrote this book in 1937. The publisher originally only printed 5,000 copies. It was an immediate best seller and went on to sell over 30 million copies. I’ve always had a very strong allergy to the idea of “networking” and trying to “win friends” and/or “influence people” so this one never quite resonated but I loved it. It’s packed with Big Ideas on how to Optimize our relationships and, perhaps in the process, win some more friends and influence some people as better humans and leaders. We explore: The #1 indispensable quality you need for Optimizing, Principle #1 of How to Win Friends (Never criticize!!), how to make a great first impression, the Golden Rule (you living it), what to do when you make a mistake, and what to think when you meet people today!</div>

In this fun, quick-reading, compelling book, Olivia Fox Cabane walks us through the practical application of the art and science of deliberately dialing our charisma up. Big Ideas we cover: The Big 3 of charisma: Presence + Power + Warmth (and how to boost each), what gets in the way (and what to do about it), the power of visualization (#1 tip) and more.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Welcome to Harry Potter #6. We kick this adventure off with an amusing scene featuring our former Minister of Magic Fudge, his successor Scrimgeour and ‘The Other Minister” for the muggles. As with all the others, this one is packed with wisdom. Big Ideas we explore include: the importance of friends (Dumbledore and scientists agree!), liquid luck (remember the U Curve—too much of a good thing *isn’t* a good thing), cleverer than most? expect correspondingly huger mistakes, the placebo effect and Ron’s goalkeeping, and walking into the arena with your head held high.</div>

He’s also one of the world’s leading authorities on the science of narcissism. In this book, he shares “The bad—and surprising good—about feeling special.” The short story? Narcissism is a lot more nuanced than we might have been led to believe. Big Ideas we explore: the Myth of Narcissus, the Spectrum of Narcissism, healthy narcissism (no, that isn’t an oxymoron), how to bring it forth in our lives, and the passionate life (passion + compassion = magic!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">George Vaillant is a psychiatrist and Harvard professor who, for 35 years, led Harvard’s 70+ year Study of Adult Development. (You learn a thing or three when you follow the development of teenagers as they grew into great-grandparents.) In this book, he tells us that we can evolve spiritually. Leaning on his experience running Harvard’s study plus cultural anthropology, ethology and neuroscience, he walks us through the biological underpinnings of the positive emotions that make up our spirituality: faith, love, hope, joy, forgiveness, compassion and awe.</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">This is a book about Alfred Adler's approach to psychology. Adler was a contemporary of Freud and Jung. Although not as widely known these days, he was one of the most influential psychologists of the twentieth century. As per the sub-title, the book was originally a “Japanese phenomenon.” It was written by Ichiro Kishimi (an authority on Adlerian psychology who translated a couple of Alfred Adler’s books into Japanese) and Fumitake Koga (an award-winning professional writer). Big Ideas we explore include the primary difference between Freud and Adler (hint: etiology vs. teleology), the importance of "separating tasks" (aka: stay out of other people's business and don't let them in yours), the ticket to freedom (hint: the courage to be disliked), the center of the world (&lt;- is not you), and Adler's guiding star (happiness defined as contribution!).</div>

<div class="line-clamp-2">Ah, The Power of Myth. This book is based on the amazing PBS interview series Bill Moyers did with Campbell shortly before he passed away and captures some of the 24 hours of filmed wisdom that hit the cutting floor. We'll learn how Campbell came up with the admonition to "follow your bliss!" (hint: it's from the Upanishads), the importance of loving our fate, how we're helped by hidden hands when we really commit to our paths and so much more.</div>

Watching Humphrey Bogart gather teary-eyed Ingrid Bergman into his arms may make your heart pound, but real-life romance is fueled by far more humdrum scenes. It is kept alive each time you let your spouse know he or she is valued during the grind of everyday life. In marriage, couples are always making what I call ‘bids’ for each other’s attention, affection, humor, or support. Bids can be as minor as asking for a backrub or as significant as seeking help in carrying the burden when an aging parent is ill. The partner responds to each bid either by turning toward the spouse or turning away. A tendency to turn toward your partner is the basis of trust, emotional connection, passion, and a satisfying sex life. Comical as it may sound, romance is strengthened in the supermarket aisle when your partner asks, ‘Are we out of butter?’ and you answer, ‘I don’t know. Let me go get some just in case,’ instead of shrugging apathetically. It grows when you know your spouse is having a bad day at work and you take a few seconds out of your schedule to send him an encouraging text. In all of these instances, partners are making a choice to turn toward rather than away.\u003c/em\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Turning toward” our partner instead of away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGottman tells us that our partners are always making “bids” for our attention.

Compassionate love is when our hearts open up to feel someone’s pain and we wish them a sense of well-being. Celebratory love is, as the name implies, when we see the awesomeness in someone else and CELEBRATE it with them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarbara calls celebratory love “gratitude’s generous cousin.” (← I love that.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe appreciate SOMEONE ELSE’S good fortune when we practice (yes, it’s a practice!) celebratory love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can do this all day every day. See someone with a spring in their step and a smile on their face? Take a moment to celebrate their apparent happiness and beam them a silent, virtual high five! Barbara silently says to herself, “May your happiness and good fortune continue!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, perhaps most importantly, when a loved one (or friend or colleague or anyone) shares a story about their success with you, CELEBRATE IT!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarbara tells us that most counseling focuses on helping couples and families deal with the challenges in their relationships.

One of the important things he says we need to address is “Community.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the chapter he dedicates to “Community,” Yuval makes some very powerful points. One of the most simple yet powerful distinctions he makes is the fact that \u003cem\u003e“Humans have bodies.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, that’s not a newsflash but it’s remarkable how easily we can forget that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe continues by saying, \u003cem\u003e“During the last century technology has been distancing us from our bodies. We have been losing our ability to pay attention to what we smell and taste. \u003c/em\u003eInstead\u003cem\u003e we are absorbed in our smartphones and computers. We are more interested in what is happening in cyberspace than in what is happening down the street. It is easier than ever to talk to my cousin in Switzerland, but it is harder to talk to my husband over \u003c/em\u003ebreakfast,\u003cem\u003e because he constantly looks at his smartphone instead of me.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of that last line, Harari has the 7th reference to that chapter’s notes. He has so many great chapter notes that are worth reading that I have a little index card serving as a bookmark for me to easily find this reference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo… I flip to page 342.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich leads us to Today’s +1 and the #1 Kryptonite for all our forms of love.

Of course, our smartphones are the ultimate suction cup for our self-absorption. Love 2.0 kryptonited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we have \u003cstrong\u003eLove 3.0\u003c/strong\u003e.

What are you training for?!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: By the tone of my approach to this interaction, you may think that I’m Mr. Outgoing Small Talker. To be clear: I’m NOT. (Hah.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, a) I strongly dislike “small” talk and b) It wasn’t until I started cultivating this Love 2.0 practice that I got comfortable initiating little interactions like this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway, back to me and Cap’n Jacked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, comes over to the car and gives me a fist bump as he says thanks. Then he tells me he does ultras and is training for a 100-miler in June.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m like, “That’s amazing.” “What did you do today?”\nCap’n Jacked: “Oh, I just ran out to the tower.”\nMe: (I have no idea where/how far that is. lol) “How far was that?”\nCJ: “Oh, about 20 miles.”\nMe: “Hah.
